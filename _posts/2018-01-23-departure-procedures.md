# Departure Procedures

 * Method of departure from an aerodrome depends on circuit direction and type of nearby airspace.
 * Early on, you'll learn to depart as close to the centre of the aerodrome as possible to start
   timing accurately, but may start from a point other than overhead as you gain more experience.
 * It's essential to check the DI for accuracy, especially at the beginning of a XC.

As soon as possible after becoming airborne:

 * Enter Actual Time of Departure (ATD). This is *not usually the same as your Set Heading (S/H) time.*
 * Note and record the Set Heading (S/H) time when you settle on the heading for the first leg of
   the flight.
 * Record new heading if different from planned.
 * Calculate and record ETA for first checkpoint:
    * Add EET (Estimated Elapsed Time) to the S/H time.
 * Calculate and record ETAs for all other checkpoints and destination.
 * Transmit a **departure report** in accordance with specified procedures.

We will go into practical details later on.

**The Departure Track**

Due to high workload at takeoff, it's a good idea to visually identify 1 or 2 landmarks along your
departure track before getting into the aricraft. Sun position can be helpful, especially early/late
in the day.

On your chart, identify features 5 - 10 nm from the aerodrome to verify you're on the correct initial
track.

These can be particularly useful if not departing from overhead the aerodrome, eg. anticipating a
clearance away from the aerodrome. When you arrive at the clearance position, then fly on to between
the identified features and continue from there.

**Navaids**

Most aircraft have ADF/VOR receivers. If you have them, there's no reason not to use them **as a backup
to your visual navigation.** Primary navigation should be map reading and DR.

**SADIE / CLEAR Checks**

As soon as you've settled on your track, do a SADIE or CLEAR check.

**Departure Report**

As soon as possible after departing and setting heading, you should record details in the flight log:

 * Departure time
 * S/H time
 * HDG (if different from planned)
 * ETA for first and remaining checkpoints, and destination.

Based on these, you should **transmit a departure report to ATC if you're in controlled airspace.**
If you've taken off from an uncontrolled aerodrome, you should **transmit your departure report as
soon as possible to the appropriate ATS unit, normally Christchurch Information.**

# Climb Procedures

Data required are:

 * TAS and required track.
 * Wind between bottom and top of climb (*climb wind*).
 * Rate of Climb.
 * Height gain from *Start of Climb* (SOC) to *Top of Climb* (TOC).

When you've completed these workings, you'll know the heading and time for climb, and horizontal
distance taken along your given track.

**Calculating Climb Time**

*Example 1: Known factors a) RoC 800 FPM, b) Climb from S.L. to 6500'. What is the climb time?*

Answer: (an easy one) - divide 6500' by 800 FPM = 8.1 minutes, so 8 minutes.

*Example 2: Known factors: RoC 650 FPM, Climb from 1500' to 9500'. What is the climb time?*

Answer:

Climb is 9500-1500 = 8000.
8000' / 650 FPM = 12.3 minutes.
12 minutes, to the nearest whole minute.

**Calculating Rate of Climb**

Same methods apply as above.

*Example 3: a) Climb from 1000' to 7500', b) Climb time 13 minutes. What is the RoC?*

Answer:

Climb is 7500-1000 = 6500'
6500 / 13 minutes = 500 FPM

**Calculating Climb Distance**

Once you have the climb time and G/S, it's possible to calculat horizontal distance. This is important
for calculating the **level cruise distance**, from TOC to end of the first leg (ie. total distance of
the track, minus distance required for climb).

G/S can be calculated when you know the climb TAS, climb wind, and track required.

*Example 4: Known factors: a) climb time 18 mins, b) G/S 95 kt, c) Climb from S.L to 8500'. What is the
horizontal distance from SOC to TOC?*

Answer: calculate how much distance is covered at 95 kt over 18 minutes.
Set 60 on the inner scale against a G/S of 90.
Read the answer off the outer scale against 18 minutes on the inner scale.
Answer: 28.6 nm, or 29 nm to the nearest whole nm.

**Combined Climb Workings**

We'll now combine the methods above into a single method normally required during the flight
planning phase.

*Example 5:

 * T/O from a runway at 1000' AMSL, climb to 7500'.
 * TAS 105 kt.
 * 10 kt tailwind component.
 * RoC is 600 FPM.*

Question: What is the climb time and distance?

Answer:

Climb height = 7500 - 1000 = 6500.
RoC is 6500' / 600 FPM = 11 minutes (10.8 rounded to whole minute)
G/S is 115 kt (105 kt + 10 kt tailwind).
Therefore, distance covered over 11 minutes at 115 kt is 21 nm. (Set rate against 115, then 11 min on inner
scale).

Answer: time to climb is 11 minutes, horizontal distance is 21 nm.

*Example 6:

 * Take off 1500' AMSL, climb to 8500'.
 * TAS 145 kt.
 * 15 kt headwind.*

Question: What is the RoC to complete the climb in 12 minutes, and what is the climb horizontal
distance?

Total climb = 8500 - 1500 = 7500'.
RoC = 7000 / 12 = 583 FPM.
G/S = 145 kt - 15 kt = 130 kt.
130 kt over 12 minutes = 26 nm.

# Mean Climb Wind

We usually take the wind at **2/3 of the way up.** eg. the wind for a climb from sea level to 9000'
will be the forecast wind at (9000 * 2/3) = 6000'.

The reason for two-thirds of the way up is because RoC diminishes at higher altitudes as engine
performance falls off, so the aircraft will spend more time climbing at altitude.

Therefore, an aircraft will *take the same time to climb 2/3 of the vertical distance in feet as it
would for the last 1/3.* Also, **winds at higher levels are often stronger**, so have more of an
impact on the overall climb.

For VFR flights, forecast winds in **ARFORs (Area Forecasts)** are &deg;T, and are normally
available for S.L, 3,000', 5,000', 7,000', and 10,000'.

*Example 7:

 * S.L = 350/10
 * 3000' = 340/15
 * 5000' = 320/20
 * 7000' = 300/30
 * 10000' = 280/40

You intend to climb from S.L. to 7500', what is the climb wind for flight planning purposes?*

 * 2/3 of 7500' is 5000'
 * Wind at 5000' is 320 / 20.

*Example 8: for the same wind forecast as above, climb from 1000' to 5500'. What is the climb wind?*

 * Climb is 4500', 2/3 of 4500 is (4500 / 3 = 1500, => 2/3 is 3000).
 * Therefore, 2/3 of climb from 1000 is (1000 + 3000) = 4000'.
 * Interpolate wind half way between 3000' and 5000' = 330 / 17.5

**NB. before the 2/3 altitude wind is interpolated, round *up* the altitude to the nearest 500', eg.
4750' becomes 5000'.**
