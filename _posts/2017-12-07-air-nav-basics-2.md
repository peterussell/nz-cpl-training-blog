# Longitude

 * Longitude is the distance between **Greenwich** (the **Prime Meridian**) and the place, along
   the shorter arc around the equator.
 * Recall that a *merdian* is half a great circle, and the opposite meridian is the *anti-meridian*.
 * The prime meridian passes through Greenwich, the anti-meridian passes just east of NZ.
 * All great circles passing through the north and south *geographic* poles are *meridians of
   longitude.*

**Prime Meridian**

 * Located at 0 deg E or 0 deg W (either is correct) **longitude**.
 * The anti-meridian is at 180 deg E/W.

**Change in Longitude**

 * Like a change in latitude, a change in *longitude* is designated **d long** or **ch long**.
 * This works the same way, eg. a change from 0 deg E to 45 deg E would be a **ch long of 45 deg.**

# Distances Between Meridians

 * Previously we saw that the distance between any two *parallels* is constant (eg. 1 deg ch lat =
   60 nm, 2 deg ch lat = 120 nm).
 * The same holds true for distances between meridians **but only at the equator**.
 * As you go further north or south the distance between lines of longitudes decreases.
 * At the poles, the distances become a point.

# Summary

 * **Meridians** are lines of longitudes, which are great circles that pass through the north and
   south geographic poles.
 * **Greenwich (Prime) Meridian** is the 0 degree reference, other meridians are E or W of this.
 * The **anti-meridian** is 180 deg E/W.
 * Meridians indicate north/south direction in degrees True.
 * Meridians corss parallels of latitude at right angles.

# Determining Position on the Earth

 * Latitude and longitude coordinates can give any point on the earth.
 * Expressed in degrees, minutes, and seconds of arc.

**Values**

 * 1 degree (&deg;) = 60 minutes
 * 1 minute (') = 60 seconds
 * seconds (")

 * 1 deg of latitude = 60 nm
 * 1 minute of latitude = 1 nm
 * 1 nm = 6080' (UK standard)
 * 1 sm = 5280'
 * 1 km = 3280'

Locations are expressed in degrees latitude and longitude, with N, S, E and W in front of or
after the measurement. Latitude is normally stated first.

*Example:* Gisborne at 38&deg; 39' 48" S 177&deg; 58' 42" E.

**However, locations in the AIPNZ are identified by placing the letter *in front of the
figures* and omitting degree, minute, and second signs.**

*Example:* S 38 39 48 E 177 58 42.

# Practical VFR

For practical VFR purposes, it's less common to state coordinates, and more common to state
position relative by **over, at** or **abeam**.

 * eg. "at Makatu", or "over the Sky Tower".

As a **distance and bearing**.

 * eg. "10 nm south of Kapiti Island", or "12 miles from the Dunedin VOR on the 020 radial."

Whatever methods are used, by preference you should use places shown on the **Visual Navigation
Charts**, or well known features. **VFR reporting points** are recommended references.
