# Navigation at Low Level

 * *Low-level navigation* = generally VFR at, or close above, 500' AGL.
 * Generally uneccessary, but sometimes required when forced down by weather.
 * Whenever doing this, important to **be concious of legislative requirements that apply to flight
   *below* 500' AGL.**
 * Height you fly at is directly proporational to distance you can see; exacerbated in fog or haze.

Following Factors must be considered:

 * **Obstructions** - although few man-made obstructions at 500' (exceptions of some powerlines etc.),
   many natural obstructions, eg. cliffs along coastlines.
    * Also include **birds**, especially in coastal areas.
 * **Checkpoints** - low level requires more checkpoints. If low level flight is *planned*, seek as
   many checkpoints as possible, mark clearly on chart, and tick them as you pass.
    * Recommended that elapsed times between checkpoints are noted on the chart.
    * If **unplanned** (especially including diversion from planned track) draw a *freehand line* and
      select any checkpoints you can identify easily. Estimate elapsed times.
    * Good checkpoints may be different for low level flight, eg. church steeples, factory chimneys, etc.
 * **Aircraft Management** - requires more attention than at high levels, may require low visibility
   configuration.
 * **Log Keeping** - generally limited to brief notes due to higher workload. Often useful to use the
   chart as a log.

# Navigation in Reduced Visibility

 * VFR in low visibility is high risk, especially if in unfamiliar terrain. Strongly consider diverting,
   either back to base, alternate, or toward better weather.
 * There are occasions where there's little choice but to continue at low level in reduced visibility,
   eg. to navigate to destination or alternate. In these cases:
    * **Make all effort to maintain visual contact with the surface.**
    * Resist temptation to climb through gaps in clouds, for these reasons:
       * Climb performance can reduce significantly in light aircraft.
       * May reqiure steep angles of bank to manoeuvre between clouds, can cost aircraft performance.
       * Severe risk of disorientation.
 * Good rule is to **avoid flying among or above cloud that covers more than half the sky (4 oktas)**.

From a navigation perspective, the main difficulties and solutions in poor visibility:

 * Checkpoints don't come into view until you're overhead.
    * Select as many additional checkpoints as practical, and estimate elapsed flying time (EET)
      between them. Select on-track checkpoints whenever possible (off-track ones may not come into view).
 * If flying in bad weather configuration, allow for this in EETs.
 * Frequently check DI -> compass.
 * Use chart effectively: mark last known position, draw clear marks on checkpoints with UTC times when
   passing them. When you have two or three, mark your TMG.

A significant issue exists if you depart from your flight plan in bad weather along a track you haven't
prepared. In this case:

 * Mark your position and time.
 * Draw a freehand line representing required track from your position.
 * Estimate true direction, deduct 20&deg;, steer an accurate heading.
 * Look for prominent checkpoints on the chart, estimate EETs between them.
 * Draw marks on chart when passing features you can definitely identify. Note your TMG, base heading
   and ETA on that (pure DR navigation).
 * If inland and terrain permitting, mark a track to the coast and follow that.
 * Advise ATC of intentions and obtain weather report at alternate aerodrome if possible.

Workload is significantly increased. As an inexperienced pilot, avoid complicated terrain, be very
wary of forecasts, and be prepared to return to base early.

**An early decision is a good decision.**

You can use GPS, VORs, or ADFs, but don't rush, verify inputs are correct, and very against visual
checkpoints. Use them as an addition to visual navigation, not a replacement.

If you're forced down due to bad weather, be aware that **other aircraft may be in the same situation**:

 * Keep a good lookout.
 * Turn on all external lights.
 * Broadcast position and intentions when required (eg. change of track).

Finally, don't be afraid to ask for Air Traffic Service help if necessary.

# Uncertain of Position / Lost Procedures

Difference:

 * Uncertain of position: expected checkpoints did not appear, doubt exists about precise position of
   the aircraft. Continue flight and be alert for next checkpoint.
 * Lost: cannot relate chart features to ground features. Continuing flight does not result in
   definite orientation.

**Uncertain of Position Procedure**

 * Enter time and current heading on flight log or chart.
 * Check DI against compass -- if your location is due to a discrepancy:
    * Apply the error to the required track from your last known position. This should give you an
      approximate current position (DR).
    * Synchronise the DI, make a heading change equal to the discrepancy in order to intercept required
      track.
 * If DI and compass *were* synchronised, can be result of missing a checkpoint, or failing to maintain
   a steady heading, or using the wrong checkpoints (eg. wrong mountain peak). In this case:
    * Note the wrong heading, make a similar change in the opposite direction.
    * If your next checkpoint doesn't appear or you can't relate ground features, start Lost Procedures.

**Lost Procedures**

 * **Altitude** - higher you are the futher you can see. Cloud or ATC clearance may prevent this.
 * **Reverse Trac** - turning back in the direction you came from is one of the most fundamental
   remedies, especially in adverse weather. Keep in mind that usually *cloud doesn't form behind
   an aircraft* -- if you turn 180&deg; and find yourself in cloud, then you've flown into adverse
   conditions. If this is the case, then the time you were flying in adverse conditions gives you an
   estimate of the time required until you're out of them again on a reverse heading.
 * **Geography** - with the exception of the central N/I, the relatively narrow width of NZ mean you
   can usually fly to the coast in a relatively short period of time. Steering on an E or W heading -
   depending on which coast is closest and safest, can be a solution.
    * In this case, us the MEF (Maximum Elevation Figure) printed on each chart graticule.
 * **Air Traffice Service Assistance** - almost all NI and most of the SI are covered by radar. The
   aircraft can probably be radar identified if high enough. If the situation is very serious, select
   7700 (emergency) transponder code. Other aircraft in the vicinity may be able to also provide
   guidance.

*Suggested plan*:

 * Note the time and orbit to give time to do calculations.
 * Check flight log or chart for heading flown since last definite fix, draw estimated TMG.
    * If heading wasn't steady, try to determine and *average* TMG.
 * The point is to arrive at a **Most Probably Position (MPP)** within an area known as the **Most
   Probable Area (MPA)**.
 * Estimate a G/S from the last positive fix, eg. use 1.5 nm or 2 nm / minute. Even a rough estimate
   can help narrow down MPA and establish MPP.
 * Mark the MPP on the chart.
 * From the MPP, produce the MPA in one of two ways:
    * Draw or estimate two lines at 30&deg; either side of track.
    * Draw two points either side of the MPP -- one 10nm before, and one 10nm after.
    * Draw the MAA sector.
 * Or:
    * Draw a circle around the MPP with a radius of **10% of the estimated distance**.
 * Once the area is established, look at the ground to see if you recognise any features.

**When in a lost situation, read from the *ground* to the *chart*.**

 * Look for roads, railways, rivers, lakes, etc. If in a valley, compare orientation to your
   (synchronised) DG. Eliminate all valleys that don't follow this orientation. Keep in mind
   20&deg;E variation.
 * If re-established at a fix, confirm it with other nearby features, then use this to continue
   to destination etc.
 * If not, **increase MPA by orbiting a larger distance.**

If the above doesn't work, determine: **should you execute a precautionary landing in the MPA, or
depart it?

The above question is based on:

 * Fuel.
 * Weather.
 * Daylight remaining.

If you believe that departing means you'd fly into high ground in poor visibility, land while you have
power and full control over the situation. This is very important with limited daylight remaining.

If you're confident that VMC can be maintained with plenty of daylight, leave the MPA via a **well
defined feature.** (eg. follow a reasonably sized road or railway -- remember these may disppear
into mountain tunnels.). These will often lead to a town or major feature that can be identified.

**Airmanship Considerations**

 * Check fuel and select speed for **maximum range** if you believe you can continue via an alternate
   route, or **maximum endurance** if you require time in the air to figure out the situation.
 * Ensure mixture is fully rich (assuming low level), watch for carb ice.
 * Record important steps you've taken.
