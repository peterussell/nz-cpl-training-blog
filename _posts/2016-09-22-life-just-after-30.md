I've been mulling over how last year played out with regard to the
(perhaps lofty) [goals I'd set for myself][goals], and a recurring theme became - man, that was
a lot of stuff to keep tabs on.

This year's simpler: something professional, something exercise-y, and something else (credit to someone from
Reddit for the concept). I'll give a quick outline here and elaborate on each in a future post.

# Professional: WXDecoder.com

I noticed about last year was that there wasn't a huge amount of momentum on any single
project (Image Workstation being the exception), which I think can be distilled to the
fractured division of time between projects, especially the price of context switching to
and from concepts and languages that have made it to the back of my not-always-stellar
memory.

This year I'll commit to working on just one project and see how far it goes. It should
be a fun experiment if nothing else.

# Exercise-y: Climbing

This one has two parts: get better, and get outside.

 - Climb 3 V8s indoors
 - Climb 3 V6s outdoors

Added incentive: a buddy and I are planning to do a climbing road-trip next year. Between that and a
healthy dose of bad nineties climbing videos, we have motivation in droves.

# Something else: Flying

 - Pass the Instrument Rating checkride
 - Get a Complex endorsement (wheels go up-and-down)
 - Log 30 hours tailwheel time

I'm considering a Commercial Pilot certificate (CPL), but some complexities exist about whether
this makes any sense. Will revisit it later.

# Other

 - The reading challenge last year was well worth it, so that stays. 18 books this year.

Updates soon, bed for now.
