# Cruise Performance (CPL Only)

Different requirements result in different cruis configurations:

 * Maximum range.
 * Maximum endurance.
 * Minimum time.

# Maximum Range

**Fly the greatest distance on the fuel carried.**

 * Obviously, the more fuel carried the greater the range, but there is a penalty in cost: more fuel =
   greater weight = greater power required = higher fuel consumption.
 * This doesn't mean you should always carry just enough fuel, but balance fuel weight with safety.

**Range flying** means using the *airframe* and *engine* the most efficiently in terms of percentage power
and airspeed, bearing in mind:

 * AUW: lower = greater range.
 * Wind: headwind decreases range, tailwind increases.
 * Air temperature: higher temperature = lower density, higher power required, shorter range.
    * *Warmer air = shorter range.*
 * Aircraft configuration: undercarriage retracted, flaps up, cowl gills closed, etc. (followe flight manual).

**Engine Power**

 * A given amount of engine power can be produced for different combinations of MAP and RPM.
 * Generally speaking, a **high MAP/low RPM settings is favourable** for efficiency and mechancial reasons.

**Leaning**

 * Correct leaning has a strong influence on use of power, fuel flow, and efficiency.
 * Many AFMs specify power settings for 'best economy' (mixture as lean as possible), and 'best power',
   where leaning is below maximum permissible.
 * In most cases: **leaning is not permitted when using *more than 81% power***.

# Specific Range

**Specific Range is the distance travelled per unit of fuel burned** (US gals, imp. gals, litres).

There are two ways of expressing specific range:

 1. Specific **air** range (SAR) = **air** nautical miles per unit of fuel.
 2. Specific **ground** range (SGR) = **ground nautical miles per unit of fuel.

If we divide the top and bottom of each equation by time, we get a new expression:

 * Specific range = nautical miles / fuel burned
    * = (NM / time) / (fuel / time)
    * = **speed / fuel flow**

**Best Specific Air Range (SAR)**

 * Means the most air nautical miles for a given amount of fuel: (**anmpg**).
 * This means we want the best **TAS**/fuel flow ratio.
 * Since fuel flow for a given engine/propellor combination depends on power, we require the best
   **TAS/power** ratio.

 * **Long Range Cruise Speed** - for many aircraft the recommended range speed is *slightly higher* than
   the 'best range' speed, which is sometimes known as the 'long range cruise speed.*
 * A time savings of about 5% can be obtained at a cost of only an extra 1% of fuel, and can also
   improve aircraft handling.

**Best Specific Ground Range (SGR)**

 * Based on the GS/fuel flow ratio, which we can use to calculate the TAS to fly at.
 * Therefore, we need to apply the *wind component* to the required TAS to obtain the associated GS,
   then calculate the number of ground nautical miles per gallon (**gnmpg**).
 * This gives us the ratio which gives the best SGR.

# Formulas

 * **SAR** = TAS / fuel flow
    * Set fuel flow (inner ring) against TAS (outer ring).
    * Read the SAR on the outer ring over '10' on the inner ring.

 * **SGR** = GS / fuel flow
    * Set fuel flow (inner ring) against GS (outer ring).
    * Read the SGR on the outer ring over '10' on the inner ring.

*Example: What is the SAR given a TAS of 120 kt and a fuel flow of 11.8 US gal/hour?*

 * Set 120 on the outer ring over 11.8 on the inner ring.
 * Read the answer on the outer ring over '10' on the inner ring

**Answer:** 10.16 anm/US gal.

*Example 2: What is the SGR given a TAS of 135 kt, a +25 kt wind component, and fuel flow of 12.5 US gal/hr?*

 * Convert 135 kt TAS + 25 = 160 kt GS.
 * Place 160 kt over 12.5 US/gal.
 * Read the answer over 10:

**Answer:** 12.8 gnm/US gal.

# Maximum Endurance

**Maximum endurance means remaining airborne for as long a spossible with the fuel on board.**

 * Typical situation is when you have to hold over a destination waiting for fog to lift. Since you're
   not flying from one place to another this isn't *range* - the distance covered has no effect on
   endurance.
 * Essentially, it is **the minimum amount of power to maintain a given altitude.**
 * The **Cruise Performance Chart** is used to determine speed and altitude where, for a given AUW, the
   fuel consumption is at its least and endurance at its maximum.

# Minimum Flight Time

 * Means flying from one place to another at the highest TAS in nil-wind conditions, or at the highest GS
   when wind applies.
 * NB. this sacrifices efficiency and must be a relatively high fuel flow to achieve this.

**Example problems** - *there are examples in the text for working SAR, SGR, and Min time / max endurance
in the textbook, ommitted here. Go and do them.*

*Recommends setting out a table:

% PWR | CAS | Alt | Temp | TAS | W/C | GS | Cons. Rate | ANMPG | GNMPG
# Summary

There are many variations questions can be asked in examinations. In general:

 * Set out workings clearly.
 * If CAS is given, convert to TAS.
 * If wind components are given and SGR is required, apply the wind to TAS to get GS.
 * If SAR is required, cover the GS column, if SGR is required, cover the TAS column.
 * Don't rush.
 * If minimum flight time is required, set highest GS (or TAS in nil-wind) for the particular AUW and
   altitude(s).
 * If endurance is required, use information from the performance chart and select the lowest fuel
   consumption rate for the particular AUW.
