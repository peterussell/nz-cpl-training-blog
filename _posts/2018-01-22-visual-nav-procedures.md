# Basic Procedures and Preparation

**Pre-flight**

 * Examine WX and NOTAMs.
 * Determine tracks, altitudes, checkpoints, turning points.
 * Select alternative route(s).
 * Establish end of ECT if flying in the late afternoon.
 * Determine fuel requirements.
 * Determine airspace, and make sure you know meteorological requirements.
 * Check ATC procedures, requirements, and frequencies (FISCOM charts).
 * Complete a flight plan/log (covered later).

Other considerations:

 * If your flight takes you beyond the coast, make sure you have serviceable life jackets, and probably
   wear them in flight.

Flight plan:

Know and follow the requirements for filing a flight plan in CAR Part 91 (Part 135 for commercial
flights). File a flight plan with ATC, or give your flight details to a person prepared to act as your
flight-follower if filing with ATC is not practiable.

**In-flight**

Goal is to follow the intended track and arrive at the ETA. To do so, you monitor your **track made good
(TMG)**, which is the **track you're actually following**, and adjust it as necessary to regain track.

**Map Reading**

 * In visual navigation, requires establishing your position by comparing ground features to the map.
 * Pre-select easily identifiable features during planning, and mark these as checkpoints.
    * Do not have to be directly on the planned track, but avoid using ones too far away (assessing long
      distances from the air is usually innacurate).
 * Select the number of checkpoints based on the situation, eg. more near busy airports where accuracy
   is important, less over sparsely populated terrain.
 * Can use the computer to determine groundspeed based on time vs. distance between checkpoints. Based
   on this you can anticipate where you're likely to be after a given amount of time. This is called
   **dead reckoning** or **deduced reckoning.**

**Drift Corrections: Track Crawling**

 * Forecast and actual wind often differ. Correcting for drift will help determine what the difference is.
 * Determine which side of track you're drifting and apply a larger or smaller correction.
 * Continue doing this in smaller increments until the drift stops.
 * Once established, prefer the DI over the mag compass for maintaining track. It's less susceptible to
   errors and changes in turbulence. Don't forget to periodically reset the DI against the compass.
 * If you find you've drifted off track, **always check it wasn't caused by an incorrectly sychronised
   DI.**
 * This method is called **track crawling.**

**Fixes, Pinpoints, Waypoints, Dead Reckoning (DR) Positions**

 * **Fix:** geographical position of an aircraft at a specific time determined by visual reference to
   features on the ground, or by radio navigation aids.
 * **Pinpoints:** similar to a fix, but determined by a single feature on the ground (fix is usually
   referencing two or more points or nav aids).
 * **Waypoint:** location or fix that can be used in an area navigation system (eg. GPS).
 * **Dead Reckoning (DR) Positions:** places where you anticipate you'll be at a certain time based
   on calculated **track-made-good** and **groundspeed**.

The best fix/pinpoint is being directly over a feature, but when using *two or more features* a visual
fix should be based on ground features located such their bearings to the aircraft cross as closely
as possible to right angles, eg. straight ahead and over the left or right wingtip. The same principle
applies using navaids (covered later).

**Symbols**

 * Visual fix/pinpoint: circle with filled dot in the middle.
 * Fix using position lines: circle with two *arrows* crossed over it.
 * DR position: triangle with a filled dot in the middle.
 * Radar fix position from ATC: circle with two lines across it, but within the circle (diff. to fix
   using position lines, but similar).

# Aircraft Management

There are two important components during navigation flight: **aircraft management** and **pilot
navigation**.

Management of the aircraft includes:

**Maintaining Balanced Flight**

If the aircraft is out of balance:

 * There's a tendency to roll and makes it difficult to maintain heading.
 * Increased drag and imprecise intake at pitot and static vents impact on IAS/CAS accuracy, and
   therefore TAS and groundspeed, which will affect ETAs.

**Flying at Planned Airspeed and Altitude**

 * Must carefully select power settings to maintain planned TAS at the planned altitude. Also recall
   that mixture and carb heat will affect these.
 * Concentrating on navigation at the expense of flying will often result in unintended climbs or descents,
   intersperse frequent checks outside when looking at charts or writing logs etc.

**Selecting Cruise Altitude**

Based on factors such as:

 * Terrain height - be aware of the rule prohibiting flight below 500' AGL (applies to mountains as much
   as flat, ie. sneaking through a saddle at 100' is illegal).
 * Cloud base - forecast and actual, eg. PIREPs.
 * Freezing level - reported or forecast.
 * Wind velocity, turbulence, and up/down drafts, especially over and near high terrain.
 * Magnetic track/altitude requirements.
 * ATC requirements - eg. controlled/special use airspace.
 * VHF reception, especially over mountainous terrain.
 * Optimal engine and aircraft performance (from the AFM), particularly with regard to AUW, and fuel
   consumption with increases in altitude.

**Assessing Weather Conditions In-Flight**

 * Be constantly alert to conditions ahead, side, and behind to ensure VFR is maintained, especially if
   you have to divert or return.
 * Use all available information - Air Traffic Services, other pilots, etc.
 * If you decide to divert, don't worry about other people's opinions. Once you've decided, don't change
   your mind again.
 * Diversions may also result from insuffucient daylight remaining - if you believe you may not be
   able to reach your destination in daylight, you should seriously consider diverting to a suitable
   aerodrome.
 * Decide on a plan earlier rather than later.

# Safety Checks

Unless otherwise directed by your instructor, carry out Safety Checks during navigation flights:

 * Shortly after departure.
 * At check points and turning points.
 * At intervals not exceeding 15 minutes.

Most training organisations use one of two mnemonics: **SADIE** or **CLEAR**:

**SADIE**

 * **S: Suction**, check in operating range.
 * **A: Amps**, check in operating range.
 * **D: DI**, check aligned with compass, check heading.
 * **I: Icing**, check for carb and airframe ice.
 * **E: Engine**, Ts & Ps, power set (correct RPM, MP), mixture, fuel (contents, change tanks if
   required), fuel pressure.

**CLEAR**

 * **C: Compass**, check alignment with compass, check heading.
 * **L: Log**, make navlog entries.
 * **E: Engine**, Ts & Ps, power set, mixture, fuel (contents, change tanks, pressure).
 * **A: Altitude**, QNH set, cruise altitude correct, clear of cloud and other traffic.
 * **R: Radio**, frequency, volume, position reports if required, navaids.

**Check fuel endurance at least every 30 minutes.**
