# Week in Review

**Flying**

I've scheduled an [instrument rating][ir]
checkride for mid-October, so preparing for that's the focal point of my
little world for the next few weeks.

I took a mock checkride on Friday last week, the feedback is that the flying was
good (tracking courses, holding altitude, flying approaches), but need work
on GPS automation, when and how it can be used, how to reconfigure it
quickly, and being intimately familiar with everything it can do.

A few weeks of study, a couple more flights, and we should be good to go.


**WX Decoder**

I'm (again) getting up to speed with React and Redux, which I'll be using to
write WX Decoder in.

[Modern React with Redux][udemy] is a stellar course by Stephen Grider,
it's the first one I've come across where I feel like I'm *really* grokking the
core ideas. I'll plan to get through this in October so I can start developing
the actual website.

**Climbing**

It appears the injuries have subsided and I'm managing to climb with a bit
more frequency. Forearm and finger strength is coming back slowly. I managed
a V6 the other night, and nearly finished a second.

# This Week..
