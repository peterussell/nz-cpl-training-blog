**Headings: True, Magnetic, Compass**

 * Use the computer as explained in the PPL section to obtain headings and groundspeeds.
 * For in-flight situations in NZ, 20&deg;E variation is acceptable, however for flight-planning purposes
   and exam conditions, **use the isogonal which applies to the greater part of the leg and apply its
   value to the nearest whole degree.**
 * To obtain **&deg;C** (degrees compass) use the *deviation card* in the aircraft you will use for the
   flight.
 * Under examination conditions it's customary to be provided with a simple deviation graph which you
   can use to derive deviation for any given heading (examples are in earlier chapters - and another
   in the sample examination in Appendix 1).

**Groundspeed**

 * When calculating headings you also establish GS, enter these into the GS column.

**Time and Distance**

 * Recall that you should enter the time for climb and descent based on total heights involved and rate
   of climb or descent.
 * Once you've entered this information you can determine the *distance* travelled through the climb
   and descent (eg. 120 kt and climb time is 8 min 30 sec, distance = 17 nm).
 * Once you've identified distance for climb (start of climb to TOC), you can determine **level cruise
   distance from TOC to the first turning point.** Same applies to descent from last turning point to
   TOD.
 * Cruise distances and times are entered, based on the GS for each leg.

**Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)**

 * You can calculate the ETAs for each leg based on the ETD (Estimated Time of Departure) and elapsed
   time for each leg.
    * *eg. if ETD is 2200 UTC and elapsed time for first leg is 14 minute, and second leg is 10 minutes,
      then ETA for:*
       * First turning point = 2214 UTC.
       * Second turning point = 2224 UTC.
 * This can be very useful in the air, for example to calculate the time of arrival at the destination
   after adding up the ETAs with the actual departure time.
 * The flight log will often also have a column for **ATA (Actual Time of Arrival)**.

*Example: if your total flight time is 75 minutes, and ETD is 2110 UTC, what is your destination ETA?*

2110 + 75 minutes = 2185 = 2225 UTC.

This should be the same ETA as the one calculated by progressively adding elapsed times to the ETD in
the ETA column. If answers do not match, you must re-calculate both the elapsed time column and ETA column.

**Fuel**

The last two columns of the flight plan form deal with:

 * Fuel consumption rate.
 * **Zone Fuel** - fuel consumed during each segment (leg).
 * You can find consumption rate information in the Flight Manual, or will be provided in examinations.
 * When you've calculated all zone fuel amounts and totalled them, **do a sanity check against the
   total flight time**.
    * Use an average fuel consumption rate and set that on the navigation computer against total flight
      time.

 * Below flight plan data, enter fuel details in the operational data, **eg. fuel for take-off and taxi.**
 * Also calculate fuel required for reserves (30 minutes under CAR Part 91), at a given 'holding'
   consumption rate (many training organisations use 45 minutes).
