# VHF Omni Range - VOR

*NB. I'll omit information on operational use of the VOR (tracking TO/FROM etc.) and only include
parts that are new or detailed.*

**VOR Ground Station**

 * Operates **111 - 117 MHz,** part of the VHF radio band.*
 * Phase signals contain two radio signals:
    * **Reference Phase** - omni-directional (sent in all directions).
    * **Variable Phase** - narrow 'beam' which rotates at a constant rate through 360&deg;.
 * Phase is different depending on magnetic bearing from the station.
    * When exactly at magnetic north, signals are in phase, when exactly at magnetic south the signals
      are 180&deg; out of phase.
 * Each **radial** is one of the 360 individual phases being transmitted (magnetic N = 360&deg; radial etc.)
 * Like NDBs, emit an identifying two-letter Morse code. Frequency and Morse identification code are
   published on VPC/VNCs, aerodrome chart section of Vol 4, and in ENR 4.1.
    * It's essential to correctly identify the station before use.

**VOR Range**

 * VHF radio waves travel in more or less straight lines, and do not bend readily. Therefore require
   **line of sight**, and higher the ground station and higher the aircraft, the greater the range.
 * When operating at low level on the lee side of a mountain range, VOR reception is likely to be nil.
   When reception is marginal, indications will fluctuate and become unreliable.
 * In general, *in the absence of high ground*:
    * **Aircraft below 5000' = about 60nm range.**
    * **Aircraft at 10,000' = about 90nm range.**

**VOR Airborne Equipment**

 * V-shaped aerial, normally attached to the top of the fin in light aircraft.
 * VOR receiver/control panel.
 * VOR indicator (omni bearing indicator).

**Operational**

 * NB. 'normal sensing' = 'in sync'. 'Reverse sensing' = 'out of sync'.

# DME

 * Designed *primarily* to give continuous distance from the selected DME ground station.
 * Can also be used to:
    * Pinpoint when used with a VOR radial.
    * Report distances from the station for separation purposes.
    * Calculate groundspeed when flying directly to or from the station.

**DME Ground Station**

 * Principal feature is the **transponder** which reacts to incoming signals from the **DME transmitter.**
 * When a signal is received it triggers a response back to the aircraft. The time taken for this trip
   can be expressed as a function of distance or groudspeed and time to station.
 * DME stations in NZ operate in the **UHF band around 1000 MHz**, hence the name "1000 Meg DME" (?).
 * Like VHF, doesn't readily bend, so requires **line-of-sight.** Low-level aircraft may experience
   service interruption.

**VORTAC**

 * When a DME is co-sited with a VOR, it's referred to as a VORTAC.

**DME Airborne Equipment**

 * A lot of variation, study the appropriate handbook or get properly briefed before use.
 * Many VORs are paired with DME - you'll receive DME information by tuning the associated VOR.
 * Modern indicators provide three modes of information:
    * Distance from the station (*NB. slant range - distance directly over the station is still a distance).*
    * Time to station (and ETA in some cases).
    * Groundspeed.
