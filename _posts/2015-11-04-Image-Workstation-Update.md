The Image Workstation project I've been working on lately is being installed today at its first hospital since a round of major updates. Most are stabilization and bug fixes, but a few interesting features:

 - moved app settings to the database instead of being stored in the .exe.config file
 - moved folder discovery & selection to a separate thread, so offline folders != unresponsive UI
 - added support for Linux folder shares

It sounds like the install has gone smoothly and I'm excited to get feedback on how things go over the next couple of weeks.
