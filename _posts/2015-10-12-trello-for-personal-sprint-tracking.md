In an effort to be a little more pragmatic about how I'm spending my time (especially
with [all these things to do this year][life-before-30]) I set off in search of an
effective way to allocate and track time during the week.

### Agile

[Agile][agile] is a methodology from software development that seems to fit the bill nicely.
Agile includes a concept of 'sprints'. A sprint is a defined period of time (eg. 2 weeks), and
has a number of tasks that are expected to be completed within that period. You provide an
estimate of how much time each task (and therefore all tasks) will take, then track the actual
time spent and compare the two values.

When you compare the 'expected' time spent on a task vs. the 'actual' time spent on a task
it's easy to tell whether you're ahead or behind of schedule. Aggregate across all
tasks (often presented in a burndown chart) and you can quickly tell exactly how much
you've lied to yourself about your superhuman abilities.

Agile encompasses many other concepts and practices, but these are the main ones I plan to use.

### Implementation
I'm using [Trello][trello] with a [Scrum plugin][scrum-plugin] (Scrum's a framework for Agile).
I've allocated 17 hours of work over the 2 week sprint, which may increase or decrease in future sprints
depending on how this trial goes. Tasks are defined and fall into one of four categories:

 - Backlog: the task queue
 - In Progress: tasks I'm working on (ideally only one at a time, but multiple are allowed)
 - Completed: yay!
 - Blocked: anything that I can't complete due to circumstances beyond 'I'm lazy'

The Scrum plugin allows you to add a time estimate to cards in Trello along with a 'completed so far'
time on the card for each task.

I should point out that Trello Boards aren't set up like the screenshot above may lead you to believe, but
it's very easy to get going without much work.  Here's how I've mapped the Trello components to
the Agile/Scrum concepts:

Each category I mentioned above is a Trello 'board', each task correlates to a Trello 'card'. Boards contain
cards. If any task requires more information then a checklist can easily be added to a card to
break it into sub-tasks. I've added colored labels which represent categories for tasks, with the
idea that it'll be easy to see how I've been spending time (or should be spending time) at a glance.

The setup took around an hour or so (including figuring out how to use it) which I consider
a small investment for what seems like will be a useful system. I'll report back.
