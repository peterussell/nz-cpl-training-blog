ForeFlight ([pretty][ff1] [unanimously][ff2] the best flying app currently available)
has a cool feature called **Track Log** that I've wanted to try out for a while now.
Track Log records flight data such as altitude and heading over time, and lets you
export it later in .kml, .gpx, or .csv formats.

A cool trick is importing the recorded data into Google Earth, which can display a
3D view of where you and your trusty Cessna have been. I didn't have
an airplane to play with this morning, but I did have an iPhone, ForeFlight, and a 20 minute
bus commute. Here's the result...

### Instructions

*Note: works on iPhone 5s - mileage may vary but this should get you most of the way.*

**Step 1: Enable the Track Log Start/Stop Control**

- In ForeFlight, go to Menu > Settings
- Scroll down to 'Track Log Control' (just past 3/4 of the way down)
- Turn on Enable Start/Stop Control if it isn't already

**Step 2: Record the 'flight'**

- On the map screen (Menu > Maps) you should see a **REC** button with a timer below it
- To start recording press the REC button, the timer will start
- To stop, press the REC button again

**Step 4: Edit log details and upload to foreflight.com**

- Menu > Track Logs shows the list of track logs recorded on all your devices
- Click on a log to modify details (name, pilot name, tail number etc.)
- Go back to Track Logs (top left button) when done editing details
- Click the upload icon to save the log to your account on foreflight.com

*Note: if you have compatible apps (eg. Google Earth) installed on your device, you
can open a Track Log directly in the app. Select the Track Log you want to open,
press the upload icon, Send To > Open In, and select the app.*

**Step 5: Download the log from foreflight.com**

- Log in to [foreflight.com][ff.com] and go to your account
- Open Track Log. You should see a list of logs on the right, including your
recent upload
- Download the .kml file for the log you want to import to Google Earth

**Step 6: Import the log into Google Earth**

- In Google Earth, go to File > Open (I read some systems may be File > Import)
- Select the .kml file you just saved and click Open

**Done!**
