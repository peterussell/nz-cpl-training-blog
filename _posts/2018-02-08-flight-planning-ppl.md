**Introduction**

 * The term 'flight plan form' comes up often, important to note it's different to the 'Flight Plan
   (Form)' transmitted to the National Briefing Office.
 * The nav flight plan form contains tabulated information on tracks, headings, speeds, etc.
 * Unless otherwise noted, the flight plan form is also the *navigation form*.

**Pre-flight Planning**

Items required:

 * 1:1,000,000 VPC.
 * Appropriate 1:500,000 and/or 1:250,000 VNC(s).
 * 2+ soft pencils, water-based felt pen and eraser.
 * Protractor and ruler with 1:1,000,000, 1:500,000, and 1:250,000 scales, or a plotter.
 * Navigation computer.
 * Flight plan form.
 * AIPNZ Vol 4.
 * Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM).

For planning purposes, we'll use a flight from Nelson, to Collingwood, to Karamea, back to Nelson.

**Turning (En-route) Points**

 * Fill in From - To columns with segments.
 * Segments: NS-COL, COL-KM, KM-NS.

**Tracks**

 * Draw your tracks between the places, and measure the angle with protractor or plotter.
 * Mentally verify the track (eg. 175&deg; should be roughly south).
 * Add each track to the flight log.
 * Tracks: 326&deg;T, 217&deg;T, 094&deg;T.

**Distances**

 * Measure length of each track with the ruler (check it twice).
 * Check the lengths against the *latitude divisions* on the nearest *meridian*. Eg. if the ruler scale
   shows 30nm, place the same ruler with the track length marked against the latitude grid. If there is
   a discrepancy, chance is you used the wrong scale.
 * Distances: 44 nm, 42 nm, 51 nm.

**Cruising Levels**

 * When determining altitude, consider spot heights either side of the track. **The longer the track,
   the further off-track you should look.**
 * The first track has the highest spot height of 3,792' close to track. Consistent with the 'mag-track
   altitude table' we should cruise at 5500', 7500', 9500', or 11500'.
 * Second leg highest spot height of 5400'. Cruise altitudes should be 6500', 8500', 10500', or 12500'.
 * Third leg highest spot height of 5934', options of 7500', 9500', or 11500'.
 * Cruise altitudes: 5500', 6500', 7500'.

**Cruise Speed - CAS and TAS**

 * At higher altitudes, allow for slower cruis speeds of light aircraft.
    * A C152 or Tomahawk will struggle to exceed an approximate cruise CAS of 85 kt - 95 kt (depending
      on cruise power).
 * We'll use an average (87 kt) for the three legs.
 * Now check the Met. forecast and establish temperature at each cruise level to calculate TAS.
 * We'll use a freezing level (FZL) from the Area Forecast (ARFOR) of 8000'.
    * First leg = 8000 - 5500 = 2500. At 2&deg; per 1000' = +5&deg;C.
    * Second leg = 8000 - 6500 = 1500. = +3&deg;C.
    * Third leg = 8000 - 7500 = 500. = +1&deg;C.
 * Use these values to calculate TAS values:
    * First leg = 95 kt.
    * Second leg = 96 kt.
    * Third leg = 97 kt.

**Calculate Headings and Groundspeeds**

 * Using the following ARFOR wind velocities:
    * 1000: 320/10
    * 3000: 310/10
    * 5000: 300/10
    * 7000: 280/15
    * 10000: 270/20
 * *Remember, these are in &deg;T.*
 * Results:
    * Leg 1: can use 5000' winds:
       * GS: 86 kt
       * WCA: 3&deg; from the right = 3&deg; left = 323&deg;T
       * Variation = 21&deg;E => 323 - 21 = 302&deg;M
       * Deviation = 0&deg;
       * **GS = 86 kt, HDG = 302&deg;C**
    * Leg 2: can use 7000' winds:
       * GS: 88 kt
       * WCA: 8&deg; from the right = 217 = 8 = 225&deg;T
       * Variation = 21&deg;E => 225 - 21 = 204&deg;M
       * Deviation = 1&deg;W = 204 + 1 = 205&deg;C
       * **GS = 88 kt, HDG = 205&deg;C*
    * Leg 3: can still use 7000' winds:
       * GS: 112 kt
       * WCA: 0&deg; = 094&deg;T
       * Variation: 21&deg;E => 094 - 21 = 073&deg;M
       * Deviation: 2&deg;W => 073 + 2 = 075&deg;C
       * **GS = 112 kt, HDG = 075&deg;C**
