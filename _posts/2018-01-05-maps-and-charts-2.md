# Chart Scale

 * **Reduced Earth** - charts are scaled down versions of the earth's surface. A reduced globe is this
   smaller imaginary globe that (or part of) is projected on to the chart.

**Chart Scale** is defined as:

> The ratio of a given chart length to the actual distance on the earth it represents.

**i.e. Scale = ( chart length / earth distance ), eg. 1 / 250,000** *(NB. units must be the same)*

Charts with a *smaller* number for the earth distance part show smaller parts of the earth, meaning
features are larger and the chart may have more detail than a chart showing a larger section of
the earth.

 * ie. *(1/250,000 shows more detail but covers less area than 1/500,000).*

**Conversions**

 * 1 km = 100,000 cm (move 5 dp).
 * 1 nm = 6080' = 12 (inches per foot) x 6080 = 72,960"
    * = 72,960" x 2.5cm (cm per inch) = 182,400 cm (= 1.82km).

*NB. to be totally precise, **1 nm = 6076', and 1" = 2.54cm.** The rounded values are OK if not
using a calculator.*

**Describing Scales**

There are a number of methods to describe chart scale:

 * **Representative fraction**
    * eg. scale of the NZ **Visual Planning Chart (VPC)** is 1/1,000,000 or 1:1,000,000. Therefore, **1cm
      on a VPC represents 5.39 nm (10km)** on the earth's surface.
    * eg. scale of the NZ **Visual Navigation Chart (VNC)** is 1/500,000 or 1:500,000. Therefore **1cm
      on a VNC represents 2.7 nm (5km).
 * **Graduated scale line**
    * Can be located anywhere on a chart where there's room.
    * Use a ruler to measure distance between two points on the chart, then measure this against the scale
      line to get the required value (eg. nm).
 * **Scale rulers**
    * Plastic rulers with various scales (eg. sm, nm) printed on them. Be careful to use the right scale.
 * **Latitude graduations**
    * In the unlikely event there's no scale on the chart, you can compare chart distances on the
      **latitude graudations** (***not* longitude graduations**) marked on the chart.
    * You can then calculate distance by remembering that 1&deg; lat = 60nm, and 1' lat = 1nm.

# Aeronautical Charts for Visual Navigation

 * **Visual Planning Chart (VPC) 1:1,000,000**
    * Used primarily for visual navigation planning.
    * Include topographical and cultural information.
    * Based on the **New Zealand Map Grid Projection**, which is similar to the Lambert conformal conic
      projection.
 * **Visual Navigation Chart (VNC) 1:500,000**
    * These charts cover all airspace in New Zealand.
    * Show detailed topographic, cultural, and aeronautical information.
    * VFR pilots should use these for in-flight navigation.
    * Also based on the NZ Map Grid Projection.
 * **Visual Navigation Charts Enlargement 1:250,000**
    * Provided for congested areas, eg. Auckland Enlargement Chart is on the reverse of the Central
      Plateau (1:500,000) chart.
 * **Visual Aerodrome Chart**
    * Detailed information on many NZ aerodromes.
    * Published in the AIPNZ Volume 4.

*NB. all charts include the scale used. Important to note the **scale on the opposite side of the
paper chart may be different** (ie. it's a different chart).*
