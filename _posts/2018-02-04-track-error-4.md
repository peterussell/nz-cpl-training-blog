# Track Error (3)

**Estimation of Heading to Make Good a Reciprocal Track**

After making a 180&deg; turn, you'll need to apply a drift correction to compensate for the original
drift correction. A rule of thumb is to apply *twice the drift factor*.

 * If you've applied left (port) drift before turning, fly the reciprocal HDG and **deduct** twice the
   drift.
 * If you've applied right (starboard) drift before turning, fly the reciprocal HDG and **add** twice
   the drift.

Explanation:

You're flying 360&deg;M and experiencing wind from the west. Your HDG is to the left of track to
allow for starboard drift. Assuming this allowance is 10&deg;, your heading is 350&deg;M.

If you make a 180&deg; turn, your new heading is 170&deg;. However, the *course* you're trying to
reciprocate is actually 360 (ie. new course of 180&deg;).

You also need to apply the same 10&deg; drift, but to the *track* of 180&deg;. Therefore:

170&deg; + 10&deg; to compensate for the original drift = the original track of 180&deg; (reciprocal).

+10&deg; drift correction = 190&deg;M = new heading.

Similarly, if your original track was 360&deg; with a 10&deg; starboard correction (for port drift).
Therefore your reciprocal heading would be the reciprocal of 010&deg; = 190&deg;.

In this case, your reciprocal track is 180&deg; (subtract the original 10&deg;), then subtract a
further 10&deg; for the reciprocal drift correction = 170&deg; = new heading.
