# Flying for Maximum Endurance

**Purpose: remain airborne as long as possible.**

 * Principle is to use the least amount of fuel to produce the power required to remain airborne for as
   long as possible.
 * Compared to cruise, this is achieved at a lower TAS/IAS.

We can use fuel performance charts:

 * *eg. from earlier examples we can use the chart to show at an AUW of 900kg, the aircraft's lowest
   fuel consumption is at 3,000' and a TAS of 83 kt.*
 * *eg (2). at 950kg, its lowest rate of consumption is 29.9 l/hr at 3,000' and 81 kt TAS.

**Look for the lowest fuel consumption rate for the All-Up Weight (AUW) and altitude on the appropriate
Cruise Performance Chart.**

# Chart Preparation

After completing the flight plan, it's recommended that you transfer *some* details to the VNC.

 * In a clear space near the track at departure point, draw an arrow in the direction of departure and
   write the magnetic heading (HDG&deg;M) alongside it, and elapsed time.
    * *In our example from the last section, we'd write 303/31 near the beginning of the first track from
      Nelson.*
 * Repeat this at the beginning of each track departing each position
   * *eg. arrow and 204/29 at Collingwood, and arrow and 072/28 at Karamea.*
 * The idea of this is to **provide quick reference information at high workload times**.

 * Examine the map for useful and easily-identifiable pinpoints along each leg or segment.
    * *eg. Motueka township and Takaka aerodrome on the Nelson-Collingwood leg.*
 * Use details from the flight plan and distances measured on the chart to determine time to the pinpoints.
 * Write the times from the previous checkpoints or pinpoints next to the pinpoints you've identified
    * *eg. '10' near Motueka, and '15' near Takaka.*
 * Some tracks may not have easily identifiable pinpoints, common for much of New Zealand. In these cases
   you can use other features, eg. easily identifiable bends in the coastline, instead. These may be
   abeam instead of overhead.
 * On the third leg, the same problem is evident. Mountain peaks can be difficult to see. It's better
   to use a lake (eg. Cobb Lake) abeam the track.
 * For all the above points, calculate either the pinpoint time or abeam time and write them on the track,
   elapsed from the last checkpoint etc.
 * **The advantage of including this information on the chart is that it makes it easy to see whether you're
   running ahead or behind time based on the times at checkpoints.**

You'll find that preparing your flight plan accurately and transferring vital information to the chart will
enable you to spend more time flying the aircraft, and may prevent doing additional calculations in the air.

The selection and marking of clearly identifiable pinpoints with 'sector' times (or **ETIs, Estimated
Time Intervals**) also helps avoid needing to use your nav computer to recalculate times.

# En-route Techniques

**Track Guides**

 * It's helpful to draw 10&deg; track guides (diverging from the departure and destination points at 10&deg;
   on either side of the FPT).
    * These make it easier to estimate your Total Correction: recall: Track Error (TE) + Closing Angle (CA)
      = Total Correction (TC).

**Diversions**

After leaving Collingwood bound for Karamea, you notice cloud and decide tracking along the coast would
be safer.

 * Simply draw a freehand line along the coast representing your required track, and eyeball the direction
   and length compared to your flight planned track.
 * A portion is parallel to the 10&deg; drift line, meaning you can use the heading of the original FPT
   +10&deg; to get the nead heading = 214&deg;M (204 + 10).
 * The distance/time is similar for this track to the original.
 * For the diversion legs (getting to the parallel track) you can compare to meridians in this case.
    * **Don't forget the chart is in &deg;True**
    * Therefore, the route from Wekakura Pt to Karamea is 180&deg;T = 180-21 = 159&deg;M.
    * You can eyeball the length, eg. approx 2/3 length of the first track, and therefore roughly
      2/3 * 17 min = 12 mins approx.

The idea is to keep it simple:

 * Draw a freehand line representing new tracks.
 * Use existing tracks, track guides (/drift lines), and lat/long grids as guides to estimate HDG,
   distance, and time.

This also highlights the advantage of flying near a coastline, do not hesitate to follow an alternative
along the coastline if there is doubt that VFR can't be maintained on your FPT over land.

**Fuel Requirements**

 * Fuel carried must be sufficient for planned flight + reserves. Regulations are 30 min VFR aeroplane,
   20 min helicopter. Usually 45 mins required by training organisations.
 * Total elapsed time for the flight is 87 minutes = 31.5 l of fuel.
 * Therefore, 30 mins fuel at cruise consumption rate (23 l/hr) is 11.5 l, total required of 31.5 + 11.5
   = 43 l.
 * **Check the flight manual for amount of unusable fuel**.
 * eg. if we have 4 l unusable, then we require 47 l in the tank before departing.

**The Load Sheet**

This will be covered in the Aircraft Technical Knowledge text. You are required to know the AUW on
take-off and landing. A Load Sheet is a form which can be used to fill out this information.

**Air Traffic Control and Airspace Requirements**

During preflight planning, examine the following for ATC/ATS requirements:

 * 1:1,000,000 VPC
 * VNC(s) as appropriate. Look for airspace boundaries, reporting points, radio frequencies, control
   zones, high-density traffic areas, and Mandatory Broadcast Zones (MBZs) etc.
 * NOTAMs
 * CHarts in AIPNZ Vol 4 of aerodromes you intend to use.

# ATC Flight Plan

 * Not a legal requirement, but *strongly recommended* to lodge a flight plan with the **National Briefing
   Office** prior to any XC flight.
    * Can be done through IFIS (Internet Flight Information Service), fax, or telephone.
 * NOTAM and MET information is available through IFIS and other sources.

 * The obvious advantage is to activate SAR facilities if overdue.
 * It's important to remember that **if you're running late, advise the nearest ATS unit of an amended
   SARTIME.**
 * Also important to terminate your flight plan at the end of the flight (controlled or uncontrolled
   aerodromes).

# Special Equipment

**Life Jackets**

 * Flight over water requires **serviceable life jackets carried for pilot and passengers.** Also highly
   recommended that the pilot wears the life jacket during flight.
 * They're expensive, so:
    * Keep away from oil, grease, paint, sharp objects.
    * Correctly fold and stow in containers after flight.

**Survival Equipment**

 * Basic survival equipment is recommended, especially when operating in remote areas.
