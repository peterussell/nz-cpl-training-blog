After a hiatus due to a snapped rear axle (guy opens car door in bike lane > swerve >
train track > over the handlebars & a broken bike) all the pieces are back together.
We ride again!

Bent brake arms still require fixing. They make about 50% contact with the rim, but
they're alright for now as long as it doesn't rain (lucky about that drought, huh?)
