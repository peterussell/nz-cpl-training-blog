Yesterday morning I finished Catch-22 by Joseph Heller. The beginning seemed really familiar, until I
realized I've tried reading it (unsuccessfully) in the past.

It has a writing style I hadn't come across before, composed from a lot of long, unpunctuated sentences.
That was a little difficult for my little head to get around, but sticking it out paid off.

In my humble opinion, Catch-22's a great book that frequently switches from quirky to comedic to life-contemplation-inducing so quickly you don't even notice. I recommend it.
