Presenting the third (*ahem*) Key Focus Area (*ahem*): Education.

### Become Reasonably Fluent in a Second Language

This one's been on the list for a long time - I'm sure I'm not alone in that sentiment. French is my language of choice because it's spoken in places I'm keen to spend at least a little more time in the future  (including Tahiti in January.. muaha etc.).

I've been using the free iPad app from [www.duolingo.com][duolingo], usually doing a couple of lessons most nights before bed. The lessons only take about 5-10 minutes each which make them nice bite-size chunks.

As of today I could to ask for a red cat, or inform my fellow baguette-lovers that the man is eating an apple. Progress.

### Read 16 Books

I've noticed a common trait shared by most people I admire is a penchant for reading - there must be something to it. Instead of pursuing any in-depth analysis (in large part due to laziness) I figured I'd just start reading more and see how it works out. And I like reading. It's sexy.

It also seems like a good excuse to spend less quality time with the TV (although I don't watch a whole heap anyway and tend to glaze over when Game of Thrones talk begins). Now there's a good excuse: 'Sorry, got 16 books that need reading'.

I don't have a reading list per se, but imagine it'll be a mix of fiction and non-fiction. So far I've finished [So Good They Can't Ignore You][sgtciy] by Cal Newport, and [Forever Flying][forever-flying], a biography about the legendary pilot Bob Hoover (my really-cool mum got me a signed copy). I'm currently involved with [Catch-22][catch-22] by Joseph Heller, which I've wanted to read for ages. See, the plan works!

After that I'm going to re-read the [Autobiograpy of Benjamin Franklin][bf], and then (or more likely at the same time) Rod Machado's [Instrument Pilot's Handbook][iph] to prep for the Instrument Pilot written exam. Annnnnd then, well, I'm open to suggestions.
