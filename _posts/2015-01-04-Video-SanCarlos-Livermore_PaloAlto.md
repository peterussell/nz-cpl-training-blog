I recorded a short flight over the San Francisco bay. I hadn't flown into Livermore
Airport as a solo pilot before so I decided to do a triangle route, including Palo
Alto, and then finish back at San Carlos.

The video includes some ATC and recorded using a Garmin Virb (not bad for
a $99 Groupon).

I plan to record more flying videos in the future and upload them under the moniker
'FlyingKiwi', feel free to subscribe to the YouTube channel if you're interested in
seeing more. This marks my first attempt at editing and uploading a video, so suggestions
are welcome. Enjoy!
