# Form of the Earth

**Shape and Size**

 * Earth is not a true sphere, distance around the equator is slightly larger than between
   the poles (about 23 nm). It's called an *oblate spheroid*.
 * For practical purposes we can assume it's spherical.

**Rotation**

 * Earth rotates anti-clockwise around the **polar axis** when looking down from above.
 * The polar axis passes through the North and South *Geographic* poles: True North (TN)
   and True South (TS).

# Imaginary Lines

 * Lines of **longitude** run N to S, also called *meridians*.
 * Lines of **latitude** run E to W, also called *parallels of latitude*.

**Great Circles**

 * Defintion: a Great Circle drawn on the earth's surface is one whose plane passes through
   the center of the earth.
 * It bisects the earth into *two equal parts: **hemispheres***.

Properties of Great Circles:

 * It is the largest circle that can be drawn on the surface of the earth, it has the greatest
   radius and least curvature.
 * Only one great circle can be drawn between two points on the surface of a sphere, unless
   the points are *diametrically opposed* (eg. the poles).
 * The *shortest distance between two points* on a sphere is the shorter arc of the great
   circle formed between the two points.
 * **Meridian:** each half of a great circle from the NP to the SP is called a meridian (a
   line of longitude).
 * A meridian and its anti-meridian (on the opposite side) form a great circle.
 * **Equator:** the great circle at right angles to the earth's axis is the equator.
 * ***Radio waves** follow great circle paths across the earth's surface.*

**Small Circles**

 * Any circle on the surface of the earth whose plane doesn't pass through the centre of the
   earth.
 * Small circles parallel to the equator are **parallels of latitude**.

**Rhumb Lines**

 * Definition: a rhumb line (RL) is a regularly curved line on the earth's surface which
   *cuts all meridians at a constant angle*. (The diagram in the text will be helpful).
    * NB. the main point here is to consider the *angle* made between the line and the
      meridian, because the *angle* is constant, it makes a curved line around the surface.
 * The *equator* and *meridians* are the only rhumb lines that are also great circles.

**Rhumb Lines & Great Circles**

From before, the smaller arc of a great circle is the shortest distance between two points.
on a sphere. Comparing rhumb lines to great circles, we see:

 * The true track rhumb line between two points on the earth's surface is the **same
   direction**. The great circle track is not.
 * The great circle distance between two places is shorter than the rhumb line distance.

# Latitude and Longitude

**Latitude**

 * The datum for latitude is the equator. By defintion, the latitude of a place is its
   **angular distance from the equator** in degrees.
    * *The text has a good diagram to explain this visually.
 * Latitude varies from 0 degrees (at the equator) to 90 deg N at the North Pole, and
   90 deg S at the South Pole. The equator is expressed as 0 deg N/S.
 * The **difference** or **change** in latitude (**d lat** or **ch lat**) is the
   difference between the paralells, either N or S.
    * *eg. if you travelled from 30 deg S, to 40 deg N, then you would have a ch lat
    (or d lat) of 70 deg N. In the opposite direction, it would be 70 deg S.

**Latitude is expressed in *degrees, minutes, and seconds.***

# Latitude and Distance

# Nautical Mile

A nautical mile is the *length of the arc* of 1 minute, 'subtending' from (coming from?)
the centre of the earth. *Again, the book has a good diagram*.

More simply: **if you draw a 1 minute angle from the centre of the earth along a great
circle, the *distance* between the two legs (of the angle coming out of the centre of the
earth) equal 1 nm.**

 * Because there are 60 minutes in a degree, it follows that a 1 degree angle = 60 nm,
   4 degree angle = 240 nm, etc.

Because of the compression of the earth near the poles, the arc (resulting from a 1-minute
angle) is slightly longer (6108') than the arc at the equator (6064').

However:

 * For practical purposes the distance is taken at **6080'**.
 * *It's actually standardised at 1852m = 6076.1', but 6080' is used for practical purposes.

# Statute Mile

 * 5280'
 * Decreed by law (hence 'statute').
 * No relationship to angular measurements, practical application to navigation is nil.

# Kilometre

 * 3280'
 * The length of 1/10,000th of the average distance between the *equator* and *either pole.*
 * Not commonly used for air distance except in some European countries.

**Latitude to Distance (NM) Calculation Example**

 * Recall that 1' (one minute, or 1/60th of a degree) angle drawn along a great arc = 1 nm.
 * Therefore, 1 degree of latitude change = 60nm (1' = 1nm; 1' * 60 = 1 degree; 1 deg = 60nm).
 * Using this, if we use the example before of a 70 deg N latitude change, we can calculate
   this is a 70 deg * 60nm = 4,200nm distance.
