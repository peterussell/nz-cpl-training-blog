First, I apologise for the hiatus. But we're here now and that's what
matters.

# Christchurch

Later this year, Eve and I have decided to sell our artisanal Ikea collection
and head south west, for New Zealand. After much deliberation - and only
changing our minds once - we've settled on [Christchurch][cc] in the South Island.

# Why?

 * It's something new, for both of us (I grew up in Wellington).
 * The 'international' airport makes it an easy single hop from
   Auckland or Wellington. Especially important for international
   visitors, and visiting my family.
 * Job market's reasonable.
 * A comprehensive flying school/club.
 * Top notch access to South Island hiking, (I don't think I can bring myself
   to say 'tramping' any more), climbing, mountain biking, ...

The decision to move wasn't frivolous. It's certainly an exciting time, but
also bittersweet. The US, for all its questionable antics, has stolen a bit of my
heart some time during the last (nearly) six years. It's a country with
opportunities, experiences, friendships, and BBQ that I never expected to
be privy to, and will always be grateful for.
