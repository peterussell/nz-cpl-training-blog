# Practice of Pilot Navigation

**Having a Well Prepared Flight Log**

Flight log typically contains columns used to record key elements of the flight, and provides an
in-flight record and actions taken:

 * Actual Time of Departure (ATD) and Set-Heading (SH) time.
 * Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) at checkpoints, turning points, destination.
 * Clearance details, and changes to those.
 * Actual arrival over pinpoints, and changes to heading if track-made-good (TMG) doesn't coincide
   with the planned track.
 * Groundspeed (G/S) checks based on distance over time.
 * Changes in Estimated Elapsed Time (EET) and ETA based on G/S checks.
 * Fuel state, at least every 30 minutes, remaining endurance.
 * Changes to plan for deviation, eg. due to fuel, daylight, weather.
    * Includes new headings and ETAs.

It's important not to clutter the flight log, so it's useful when needed for immediate assistance.

Many pilots (particularly helicopter pilots) prefer to use the chart as a flight log, writing details
adjacent to the tracks. However, charts used as flight logs can deteriorate quickly.

**Clutter in the Cockpit**

There can be a lot to carry for a XC flight (charts, AIPNZ Vol 4, pencils, nav computer, means of
measuring distances, watch, ...). It's best to have all your equipment in a folder or small satchel
by your side. It's important that the least number of items are on your lap at one time.

AIPNZ Vol 4 is bulky, many pilots take out only the pages they need. If you do, be wary that this can
cause pages to deteriorate. If you use the whole document, mark the pages you need (paperclips, etc.).
Leave it in the pocket or between the seats, and only bring it out when you need it, eg. when the
aerodrome is in sight.

When in the circuit, there should be no navigation equipment on your lap at all.

# Map Reading

**Basic Factors**

Success of map reading depends on being thoroughly knowledgable on four basic factors:

 1. Direction
 2. Distance
 3. Groundspeed
 4. Selection and identification of landmarks and checkpoints.

We've covered the first three, so we'll look at checkpoints.

**Checkpoint Features**

Considerations for selecting checkpoints:

 * Distance from planned track.
 * Prevailing visibility.
 * Dimensions of the features.
 * How the features might blend in with their surrounding area.
 * Plan view or side view, depending on whether flying high or low respectively.

Preferably features should be unique to the area so they stand out.

Long narrow features are useful because:

 * When parallel they can help maintain track.
 * When close to perpendicular they are useful for groundspeed checks.

**Railways vs. Roads**

Railways and roads can look similar, but it can be useful to remember that *they can only have gentle
bends*, as opposed to roads which often meet at right-angles.

**Other Useful Features**

 * Major powerlines stand out clearly, eg. the main power line grid along the Desert Road.

# Measuring Distance & Direction In-flight

It can be difficult to use a full-size ruler in flight, so some other options are:

 * Small piece of plastic with 1:500,000 and 1:250,000 scales drawn on.
 * Using the size of your thumb for estimates.
 * Using scales on the E6-B.

Direction can be determined either:

 * With a small protractor.
 * Estimating plotted lines against lines of long/lat, by dividing a 90&deg; intersection into 45*deg;
   and 22.5*deg; intervals.

*In either case, don't forget to deduct variation to get magnetic headings.*

**Checkpoints Over/Near Mountainous Terrain**

 * **Mountain tops** which show clearly on your chart can be very difficult to identify when viewed from
   above, unless the mountain is isolated.
 * Mountain peaks can be difficult to identify by *height* because they tend to look the same.
 * The same applies to **valleys**, they can be obvious on the map, but look very similar to each other
   when flying.
 * The same applies to **rivers and streams**, which can alter their appearance significantly when
   viewed from above, depending on season and weather - even a large river can merge with the countryside
   during a hot dry summer.

General rules for flying over *unfamiliar mountainous terrain:*

 * Only use mountain peaks as checkpoints if they can be clearly identified from surrounding mountains.
 * Only use major valleys, and always verify orientation against DI.
 * Only use major rivers.

Better features to use as checkpoints:

 * Distinctive coastal features.
 * Lakes and major rivers, especially with outlets to the sea.
 * Major towns.
 * Major industrial plants (abattoirs, forestry plants, cement plants, etc.)
 * Isolated mountains (eg. Mt. Taranaki).

Be careful using small towns in unfamiliar areas, NZ has a lot of similar looking small towns show well
on a chart, but in reality are only a gathering of a few houses.

**Intervals Between Checkpoints**

 * Closer together near busy airspace (often between **Visual Reporting Points**), further apart
   otherwise.
 * **Rule of Thumb:** no later than 30 minutes flying time, no less than 12 minutes flying time.
   At 120kt G/S: between 60 miles and 24 miles.

# Check Points and Dead Reckoning

When you pass a checkpoint, you know track direction, required heading, and distance, which allows you
to **calculate groundspeed and determine time.** This can be used to determine dead reckoning to the
next checkpoint.

While *en-route to the next checpoint*, you can carry out Safety Checks, position reports, check
fuel state/remaining endurance, etc.

Start looking for the next checkpoint about 3-5 minutes out.

Groundspeed and heading changes: if there's any wind at your cruise altitude, keep in mind that
any heading change larger than about 15&deg; will likely result in a G/S change. If you've calculated
G/S from a previous leg, it needs to be adjusted.

**Remote Areas**

In some areas, there may be minimal well-defined features. In these cases it's very important to be
on your established track before you reach featureless terrain, and ensure you've settled on a suitable
heading. **Use DR navigation, and importantly: maintain a steady DI heading, frequently checked
against the compass.**

# Chart Orientation

Textbook recommends *track up*:

 * Be wary of southerly headings, where south is 'up'.
 * Be careful not to confuse heading with track where there's a drift correction angle. *Always relate
   checkpoints to your TMG (track you're actually following) not your heading*.
    * eg. if a checkpoint is over your nose instead of off to the right, it could be because your
      WCA means you're pointing right of track.

Except in circumstances where you're unsure if position, it's recommended to read **from the chart to
the ground.**

**Small Diversions**

You may occasionally have to divert from your planned track due to clouds or other phenomena. Under
these circumstances, draw a freehand line on the chart, estimate &deg;T and then &deg;M, then
follow the new track. Calculate new checkpoints and follow them. More on diversions is covered later.
