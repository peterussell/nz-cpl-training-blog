I'm jumping on the bandwagon, if only to see what the fuss is about, and will
attempt to make an iPhone application this month. I'm excited to try out a new
language and developing for a new form factor, having never programmed anything
for mobile before.

The goal is to write a basic [checklist][wikicheck] app for the Cessna 172SP,
which should be a manageable task but allow room to add fancy features later
on. A number of good checklist apps already exist so this is just 'for teh lolz',
as it were.

Before all that hooplah, it's time for the quintessential Hello World app. I'm
following the bite-size tutorials at [codewithchris.com][cwc] and now I have this:

I'm using Swift (I hear it's all the rage) and Xcode 6.1.1. Topics covered so far:

 - iOS MVC overview
 - creating a new project
 - navigating the Xcode workspace
 - adding a Label object to the storyboard, changing text
 - running the iOS simulator, changing device type, and screen orientation (⌘ ←, ⌘ →)
 - autolayout, using alignment constraints to center text vertically/horizontally

They say the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single iPhone app. So, onward!
