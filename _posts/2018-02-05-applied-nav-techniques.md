# Applied Navigation Techniques

**Diversion Procedures**

 * Many occasions might require a diversion, eg. low localised cloud, ATC instructions in controlled
   airspace.
 * Often this can be dnoe with geographical features, eg. coastline, powerlines, but sometimes it must
   be done with **dead reckoning**. In these cases you need to be careful due to using this technique
   over terrain you probably didn't plan for.

One technique is to divert from your track ('off-track') at a given angle, and rejoin ('rejoin track')
at the same angle.

 * THe heading change from the off-track to the rejoin track is therefore the **sum of the two angles**
   (or double the angle in this case, since both angles are the same).
    * eg. if you divert at 30&deg; left, the once the off-track portion is complete, you turn 30&deg;
      right. This gets you on a parallel track. A further 30&deg; right is required to rejoin at a
      30&deg; angle, making the heading change a total of 60&deg;.
 * When you intercept the planned track at the end of the diversion, the same angle should be applied
   to maintain planned track (30&deg; left in the example above).

Depending on the size of diversion, you may have to **parallel the track** for a period of time, in
which case the two angles are used to get on to and off of the parallel track.

**60&deg; Diversions**

 * 60&deg; can be a good diversion angle to use, because the three sides of a 60&deg; triangle are
   equal.
 * Therefore, with a 60&deg; diversion, and no parallel part to the diversion, you know that the
   diversion **twice as long** as the planned track (assuming nil wind conditions etc.)

*Example: at 1503 UTC you divert 60&deg; right for 4 minutes, then make a 120&deg; left turn and
return to intercept the planned track. Your original ETA is 1621 UTC, what is your new ETA?*

Answer:

Each diversion leg is 4 minutes, and the original track you would have flown is also 4 minutes.

Therefore, the additional time is the difference between the diversion (8 minutes) and the planned
track time (4 minutes) = 4 additional minutes.

Therefore, the new ETA is 1621 + 4 minutes = 1625 UTC.

**Summary**

 * Make a timely decision to divert.
 * Check the DI against the compass.
 * Turn off track to a heading of 60&deg; left or right.
 * After an appropriate time interval, either turn 120&deg; in the opposite direction to intercept the
   planned track, or 60&deg; to parallel it.
 * At the end of the same time interval, turn left or right to maintain the flight planned track.
 * At each turning point, **note the time and new heading on the flight log**. It's not uncommon for
   a diversion to result in a return to base - this written record makes it easier to backtrack.

**Diversions to an Alternate Aerodrome**

It cannot be over-emphasised that when you're faced with conditions worse than forecast, and likely to
exceed the limits of your experience, you should make an early decision to avoid them, and divert
to an alternate aerodrome or return to base if necessary.

Other situations may also require this, eg. running out of daylight/fuel, mechanical problem, sick
passenger.

 * During flight planning, identify suitable aerodromes on either side of flight plan track(s).
 * For each, attach some kind of marker (eg. paperclip) to each aerodrome's charts for quick access.
 * Take note of airspace and controlled aerodromes on either side of track.

 * If the alternate is not in visual range, you can use the 1-in-60 rule.
    * Recall: **although the 1-in-60 rule shouldn't be used for heading changes of more than 15&deg;**,
      you can use it if it's urgently required.
 * To use the 1-in-60 rule you need:
    * Distance of the aerodrome from your current track.
    * Distance to the aerodrome.
 * It can be helpful to draw a free-hand line on the chart identifying the new required track. Can
   also be helpful for identifying useful ground features.

**Once the decision to divert has been made, save time by altering heading towards the alternate.**
Then head for an obvious ground feature you can use to track to the alternate.

Once done, **also advise ATC of your intentions**.

*Example: tracking to your destination on a heading of 058&deg;M, advised at 2204 UTC of a line of
thunderstorms across your track. G/S is 108 kt.

You decide to divert to an aerodrome right of track and ahead of present position, 36 nm to run and
6 nm off track.

 1. What is the required heading to the alternate?
 2. What is the ETA for that aerodrome?*

Answers:

 1. 10&deg; (CA = distance off x (60 / distance remaining) = 6 x (60 / 36) = 6 x (5 / 3) = 30/3 = 10.
 2. 36 nm at 108 kt = 20 minutes; => 2204 UTC + 20 minutes = 2224 UTC.
