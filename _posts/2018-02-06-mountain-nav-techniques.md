# Mountain Navigation Techniques

 * Experience is the most important factor in safe mountain flying. As a novice, carry out mountain
   flying in more or less ideal weather conditions and with sufficient altitude to see well ahead.
 * Most important lessons is *decision making*. Eg. flying over the Inland Kaikouras from Christchurch
   to Blenheim is fine for an inexperienced pilot in good weather and light wind, but not if visibility
   and cloud reduce the safety margins. In this case, diverting to the coast side (if weather is good)
   may be the best decision, but may also include back-tracking and 'losing' time.

**Stick to your decisions.**

 * Many cases are similar, a short route over mountainous terrain vs. a longer route over flatter
   terrain. Always have options open to divert to lower terrain. If that is threatened, turn back or
   use another escape route.
 * *Always have an escape route.*

Navigation over mountains is not too different to flying over low terrain, but there are some factors
to consider:

 * It is more difficult to pinpoint your position (more difficult in winter with snow hiding features).
 * Often tempting to point to the wrong peak -- always check against DI before flying toward a major
   peak.
 * Wind is affected by mountains. Drift and G/S may be different to planned.
    * **To avoid turbulence and downdraughts, generally best to keep to the *windward side* of a ridge
      and parallel the required track if necessary.**
 * Cloud is common over mountains. It's not uncommon to mistake cloud formations for peaks. Can be
   disorienting -- fix by coordinating visula orientation with DI/compass.
 * Multiple valleys often diverge from a junction, and tempting to follow the widest one (which may be
   the wrong one). **Always check valley orientation against DI/compass.**
 * If you're forced below ridge height, it's easy to mistake the ridge for natural horizon -- could
   be at an angle. If paralleling, could result in a climb - always watch the ASI.
 * Power can be limited and can affect ability to climb out of trouble. Especially true at altitude
   over mountains.
 * Often unable to observe low level weather on the other side of mountains until you're there. Quite
   common flying toward the west coast of the SI, where you only see cloud after crossing the
   mountains.

**Safety Tips**

 * **Proper preflight preparation**
  * Day before:
     * Ensure charts are current and adequate for route (and diversions).
     * Examine charts for suitable landmarks and distinguishing features along the route. Mark them
       clearly on the chart.
     * Ensure you're able to calculate HDG, GSs and Times on your flight computer.
     * Make use of local knowledge (pilots, organisations).
     * Plan route over lower parts of mountain ranges if practicable.
     * Determine end of ECT, allow plenty of time for a possible diversion.
  * Obtain a thorough MET briefing:
     * Route, destination, alternate aerodromes.
     * Do not plan to fly above cloud for long periods of time (reduced visual navigation).
     * Try to determine an altitude where you'll be out of potential turbulence and downdraughts.
       *Flying in turbulence can be fatiguing.*
  * Obtain a thorough operational briefing:
     * Listen carefully to your briefing officer, write down any items required for the safe
       conduct of the flight.
     * Always complete a full navigation and fuel plan, and notify details of your flight to ATS
       or reliable flight following organisation.
  * Prepare your operational (flight) plan:
     * Check tracks and distances mentally to sanity check (eg. tracks aren't 180&deg; off, etc.)
     * Check drift and EETs are approximately correct.
     * Plan on flying as high as practicable (subject to wind velocity and weather):
        * Better picture of the country layout.
        * Better terrain clearance.
        * Better radio reception.
        * Possibly smoother flight.
     * Allow adequate fuel for flight, reserves, diversions.
     * Set out a plan for what will happen if checkpoints aren't identified as expected.
     * Early departure times are often better flying conditions (cooler air = better performance,
       smoother flight.)

**Summary of Practical Aspects**

 * Plan thoroughly, prepare a flight log or enter details on chart.
 * File a flight plan, or use services of a flight following organisation.
 * Fly headings, altitudes, and speeds accurately.
 * Maintain an accurate record of events and actions.
 * Keep DI synchronised.
 * Look for checkpoints *2 or 3 minutes ahead of the ETA*
 * Keep a thorough record of fuel state.
 * Plan to arrive at destination with at least 1 hour daylight remaining.

# Fight Planning and SARTIME

Lodging a flight plan can be done via telephone, fax, or internet (ask flight instructor for details).

 * When lodging the flight plan, you're required to **nominate a SARTIME**.
 * The SARTIME is **the time when Search and Rescue will be alerted if a pilot has not terminated the
   flight plan at or before that time.**
 * SARTIME does not necessarily have to be at the destination aerodrome.
    *eg. if you plan to cross Cook Straight, you could nominate a SARTIME for arrival at the other side.*
 * If you *don't* file a SARTIME for arrival at the destination, make sure you **update your SARTIME
   when you've reached the point you originally filed it for**.

**Difference between ETA and SARTIME**

 * ETA: estimated time of arrival at a certain place.
 * SARTIME: nominated time, usually after ETA, at which you expect Search and Rescue to initiate
   procedures.

If your flight is delayed and your SARTIME will be exceeded before you wish to terminte the flight
plan, **amend the SARTIME by radio.**
