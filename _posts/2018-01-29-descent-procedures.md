# Descent Procedures

Descent is seldom done at the best speed for range or endurance, and normally done near cruise speed
for the following reasons:

 * Converting height into speed means you can maintain airspeed at reduced power, a fuel saving
   aspect.
 * Optimum engine temperature can be maintained (not too hot, or cold).
 * Visibility is better from the cockpit, lower descent speeds require a higher nose attitude.

**Top of Descent**

This is the point where the descent starts, and moves depending on descent speed, power setting, wind
component, and altitude loss.

 * For a given **airspeed**, higher power settings = shallower, longer descent.
 * For a given **power setting**, descent is shallowest and longest when **range speed** for the descent
   is selected (range speed is explained in a later book: Principle of Flight).
 * When descending into a **headwind** (low G/S) the descent will be steeper and shorter.
 * When descending with a **tailwind** (high G/S) the descent will be shallower and longer.

*Example: if ROD is 500 ft/min, how much time is required to descend from 6000' AMSL to S.L.?*

6000 / 500 = 12 minutes.

*Example: If the time for descent is 9 minutes, what is ROD for 8500' to 1500'?*

8500 - 1500 = 7000'

7000 / 9 minutes = 780 ft/min (text says 777 ft/min, calc with E6-B is approx. 780 ft/min).

*Example: ATC says to commence descent from 7500' at 22nm from the S.L. aerodrome. You must arrive
overhead at 1500' AMSL. You intend to maintain IAS of 120kt, and temperature is +16&deg;C at 4000'.
Headwind is 20 kt.

What ROD should you use to arrive overhead at 1500' AMSL?*

7500 - 1500 = 6000' descent.

TAS = 120 kt IAS at 16&deg;C and 4000' = 129 kt

Headwind = 20 kt, therefore GS is 124 - 20 = 109 kt.

22 nm at 109 kt = 12:06

6000' descent over 12 minutes = 500 ft/min.

# Descent Winds

As in climbing, descending will expose the aircraft to different winds. Because ROD is normally
constant (recall that climbs often slow near the top), **it's customary to take the halfway wind as
the average.** Eg. descending from 8000' to S.L. we would use the 4000' winds.

*Example: when descending from 9500' to 1500' with the following winds, what is the mean wind
velocity for this descent?

 * S.L. : 160/15
 * 3000' : 170/20
 * 5000' : 200/30
 * 7000' : 240/35
 * 10000 : 260/40*

9500' to 1500' = 8000'
=> 1500 + 4000 = 5500'

Wind at 5000' is 200/30, wind at 7000' is 240/35

Wind direction change is 40 degrees over 2000' = 10 degrees per 500'
=> at 5500', wind direction is 210&deg;

Wind speed change is 5 kt over 2000' = 1.25 kt over 500'
=> at 5500', wind speed is 31.25 kt = ~31kt

Therefore, wind at 5500' is 210/31.

*More applications of descent winds are covered in a later chapter (Chapter 9: Flight Planning).
