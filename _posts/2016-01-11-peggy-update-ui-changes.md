Hello from New Zealand!

I made use of some airport downtime to tidy up the
UI a little bit. It's still a long way from its final
incarnation, but at least represents the idea of entering a command,
then having the command and response displayed and scroll upwards
from above the input window.

The next two tasks, in no particular order:

 - hook up the web UI to the C++ game server
 - set up a public web server (probably a quick 'n dirty job) so anyone can try out the game

As always, [source is available on github][gh].
