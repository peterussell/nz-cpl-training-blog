I live in a small one-bedroom apartment with my girlfriend and her (ahem, 'our') dog, which is also where I currently spend the majority of my working life. Every now and then it's nice to get a change of scenery and I've discovered that the cafe at Wholefoods is one of the better spots.

# Pros

 - reasonably fast free wifi, allows VPN access
 - always seems to be space to get a reasonably secluded spot
 - good food, good coffee, good beer (for when things have really gone pear-shaped)
 - parking garage (SF parking is turrble and/or expensive)
 - ample power outlets
 - choices of wooden seats or couches

# Cons

 - wifi times out after 20 mins (although there may be ways around that...)
 - working on a wooden seat for hours isn't ideal

Many of these are common between Wholefoods and other cafes, but having looked around for places for a while now I find that good reliable internet, and the quality and variety of food (there's a proper kitchen, or a by-the-pound hot and cold buffet in the supermarket proper) isn't always so easy to come by.

The apartment we've moving to in Portland has a second bedroom, it'll be nice
to have a more dedicated office space and not be living the majority of my life within about 100 square feet. Still, it's fun to get out try some different work environments.
