# Track Guides

After completing a planned route, you can use 10&deg; (or some instructors prefer 5&deg;) track guides.
These are drawn from the departure aerodrome and the destination aerodrome, or from the next checkpoint
if applicable.

Purpose:

 * Estimate TE and Closing Angle (CA) within 10&deg;.

*NB. Based on figure in textbook...*

 * You can see in the figure the TE is approx. 6&deg; right, and CA approx. 8&deg;.
 * Even if estimated as 5&deg; and 7&deg;, they're will within limits for VFR navigation.
 * **Adding the TE to the CA gives a TC of 14&deg left.**

**The advantage of Track Guides is you don't have to calculate distances along track, you simply estimate
TE and CA, add them, and make the TC heading change.**

Disadvantage: flight planned track will be intercepted at the destination aerodrome, which is often too
far to be acceptable.

Alternative: "1-in-60 rule".

# The 1-in-60 Rule

Based on the fact that:

 * **1 nm subtends (forms) an angle of 1&deg; at a distance of 60 nm.**
   * ie. at 60 nm from a point, a distance of 1 nm perpendicular is equal to 1&deg;.
   * Following on, at 60nm, 5 nm = 5&deg;, 12 nm = 12&deg; etc.

For in-flight purposes, the point is that if you know how far you are, and how far off track you are,
you can determine the track error.

Alternatively, if you know the distance travelled and track error, you can calculate distance from
the planned track.

The same rule applies for smaller distances from the origin, multiply or divide the error as required:

 * eg. at 30 nm travelled, an error of 12&deg; means you're 6 nm off track.
 * eg 2. at 90 nm travelled, an error of 21 nm off track means your TE is 14&deg;.

In general:

 > **(60 / Distance travelled) = (Track Error / Distance off Track)**

**NB. When applying the 1-in-60 rules, use the distance gone and distance to go along the *flight
planned track*** (not the TMG).

*Example: you've travelled 90 nm and are 5 1/2 nm left of required track. What is the track error?*

60 / 90 = TE / 4.5
=> TE = (4.5 * 60) / 90
=> TE = 270 / 90 = 3&deg; left

*Example: you're 10 nm right of track after 150 nm travelled. What's the track error?*

60 / 150 = TE / 10
=> TE = 600 / 150
=> TE = 4&deg; right

**In-Flight Calculations**

It can be handy to rearrange the formula for in flight, where you want to know the track error
in degrees, which can be hard to measure with a protractor, where it's easier to measure the
two distances:

TE = Distance off track * (60 / distance gone)

*Example: What is the track error if you've travelled 86 nm and 3 nm right of track?*

TE = 3nm * (60 / 86)
=> TE = 3 * (0.7)
=> TE = 2.1&deg; right of track.
