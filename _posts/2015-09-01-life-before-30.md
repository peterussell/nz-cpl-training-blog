Recently, admist a flurry of fly-in camping (a first), day baseball (also a first), and general decadence, I encountered my 29th birthday. So, before this whole life thing gets carried away and I'm a *30 year old* I'd like to try and get some things done. Time to don my list making pants.

As some golf-putter-swinging-keynote-presenting-types might say, I've identified five key focus areas. I'll write more about the whys and hows of each in a future post.

### Technology
 - complete development on the Image Workstation (IWS) app I've been working on, to a point where it can be installed and used easily and reliably. Set up a proper build system (automated tests and nightly builds) and bug tracking systems
 - release a first version of Peggy, a text adventure game I started working on when I moved to San Francisco
 - develop some kind of web-based thing in an attempt to improve my JavaScript chops
 - fortnightly posts (at least) to track progress

### Flying
 - Instrument Rating (IR)
 - take an intro aerobatic flight
 - (bonus) Commercial Pilot Certificate (CPL)
 - (bonus) tailwheel endorsement
 - (bonus) aerobatic checkout, Super Decathlon


### Education
 - become reasonably fluent in a second language
 - read 16 books (bonus: 20 books)

### Health
 - climb V7 indoors
 - (bonus) climb V8 indoors
 - weight (back) under 85kg

### Finances
 - student loan under $10k
 - (bonus) student loan paid off
