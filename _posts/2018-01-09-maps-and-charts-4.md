# Visual Navigation Chart (VNC)

 * 1:500,000 and 1:250,000
 * Designed to give VFR pilots detailed topographical, significant cultural, and aeronautical
   information.
 * Should be used *in flight* (as opposed to a VPC).
 * **Only controlled airspace with *lower level* below 9500'** is shown, **except for the Queenstown
   and Southern Alps VNCs** which show controlled airspace to FL175.
 * Thus, LL550 means lower limit of the airspace is 5500', and the upper limit is at or above 9500'.

Presentation of information is similar to VPCs so won't be repeated, but note:

 * **Aerodromes** are identified by the usual symbol (blue for visual, purple for instrument).
    * On 1:500,000 VNCs the label contains name, frequencies, and elevation, **but not runway length.**
    * On 1:250,000 VNCs, **runway length *of the longest runway* is included in the label.**
    * Other symbols (parachuting, model aircraft, gliding, etc.) can be included.
    * *NB. a 'W' below a glider means **'winch-launched'** gliding. A smaller elevation figure can be
      included next to a symbol to indicate the upper limit (eg. winch-launched gliding up to 2500').
 * **Runway Depiction**
    * Aerodromes on both 1:500,000 and 1:250,000 show orientation of the longest runway with lengths
      **less than 1800m.**
    * For runways **1800m and longer** they depict the entire runway layout.

# Aeronautical Information

All controlled airspace boundaries are the same as the Planning Chart, but when **"sectors"** are
present in **Control Zones**, they are shown as **dashed blue lines.**

 * **General Aviation Areas (GAA)
    * Shown as 'GXXX' (eg. G123).
    * The label may indicate 'ATC Approval', 'ATC Notification', or 'DAY' depending on the requirements
      for activation of the GAA.
    * The areas, as well as **VFR Transit Lanes** are shown as **solid wide blue lines.**
 * **Instrument Approach Procedure**
    * At instrument approach aerodromes and heliports *outside controlled airspace*, a teardrop symbol
      is used to identify the **final instrument approach track, extending 7nm.**
 * **Visual Reporting Points**
    * Indicated by a two-colour diamond.
    * Reporting point is at the end of the pointer.
 * **Waypoint**
    * Fix or location (eg. reporting point or radio beacon) which exists in a navigation system (eg.
      GPS).
    * Can be fly-by (unfilled) or fly-over (filled).
 * **Wire (cable) Hazards**
    * Highest span height is shown if known.
 * **Special Messages**
    * Provided in some locations in red Special Message boxes, with a number in an inverted-colour circle.
    * The number matches a textbox with information about the message, shown elsewhere on the chart.
 * **Obstructions**
    * Obstructions shown on 1:250,000 charts **are not always shown on 1:500,000 charts**.
    * Be particularly vigilant if flying low level using a 1:500,000 chart.

# Legend

 * Contains additional information, as well as in floating boxes containing brief information on classified
   and special-use airspace.
 * On double-sided charts, legend is printed only on one side.

# Position Information

Available on charts through a latitude-longitude grid:

 * **Parallels of latitude** - indicate degrees N or S, depicted as slightly curved lines running across
   the chart at each whole and half degree. Because these are *rhumb lines* they can *never* be straight
   lines on a Lambert chart. Whole degrees are labelled down the side of the chart, with markings for 
   each minute of latitude.
 * **Meridians of longitude** - are the directions of True N and S, and are *straight* lines which are
   approximately vertical, but *converge toward the nearer pole)* (ie. bottom of the chart in the southern
   hemisphere). Convergence isn't readily apparent on the small area covered by Visual charts. Meridians
   are labelled in whole and half degrees, E or W of the prime meridian. Graudations for each minute of
   longitude are also marked.
