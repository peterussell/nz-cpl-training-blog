In July I'll be flying from California to Wisconsin for [EAA Airventure Oshkosh][eaa] with a
couple of friends - suffice to say I'm pretty damn excited.

We've snagged a swanky Cessna 182 G1000 for the trip, so part of the prep requires I get
around to sorting out my high performance endorsement and glass cockpit checkout. Here's a
quick video from the first of two G1000 checkout flights.

We departed Palo Alto and flew to Petaluma (O69) then looped back to Palo Alto. Due to some
pretty gnarly looking clouds over San Francisco we transitioned via the Oakland class Charlie
airspace rather than taking the more usual Golden Gate bridge route ([here's a rough map of
the route][skyvector]).

Enjoy!
