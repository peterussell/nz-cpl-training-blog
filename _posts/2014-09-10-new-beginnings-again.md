Recent conversations got me thinking about reviving an online
spot to keep track of all that's going on. Ladies and
gents: here it is.

The old Drupal site died a slow and very dull death. It was *mostly*
OK, but when it came to some tasks the struggle was real
(inserting an image was like an 8-step process). It was also slow
as balls.

[Glenn][glenn] told me about Jekyll, which uses markdown
(used by [GitHub][github]) with some other bits, then spits out static
HTML files.

It gives enough flexibility to be useful without being
a maintenance nightmare (we'll ignore the fact that I don't really
know how to write markdown). It should also be super fast and - possibly
best of all - means Vim for editing instead of those mediocre-at-best
WYSIWYGs.

In the interest of [JFDI][jfdi] we're kicking things off with basically
all the defaults in place. Rough edges will be smoothed as time permits.
Just think of it as some crazy amateur-blog adventure.

Or, something.
