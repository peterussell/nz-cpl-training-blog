# Track Error (2)

**Procedure on Regaining Required Track**

When you've applied the closing angle and are close to regaining the required track:

 * Apply the CA (closing angle) in the opposite direction. This will put you on a parallel heading to
   the planned heading, but if drift caused the error then this won't be sufficient.
    * *eg. planned heading of 090&deg;M, CA heading of 083&deg;M, then you need to apply the same
      amount as the CA (7&deg;) in the opposite direction, ie. back to 090&deg;M.
 * Calculate the wind velocity and apply drift correction.

The second part can be done in one of two ways:

 1. With a flight computer, then apply the result.
 2. Using the original TE (track error) calculated.
     * *eg. 3 nm off planned track after 30 nm, means a TE of (distance off x (60 / distance travelled)
       = 3 x (60/30) = 3 x 2 = TE of 6&deg;. Therefore, apply 6&deg; correction to the planned heading.

**Practical Example**

*On a flight form Wellington to Rotorua, you arrive overhead Taupo and turn to 359&deg; at 0330 UTC, to
maintain a track of 017&deg;T (357&deg;M, allowing for 20&deg;E variation and 2&deg; drift).

At 0339 UTC, your distance gone is 16 nm, and distance off track at 2 nm. What is the TE?*

TE = 2 x (60 / 16) = 2 x 3.55 = about 8&deg; left.

*What is your G/S?*

GS = 16 nm / 9 minutes = 107 kt.

*You decide to regain your track, joining the planned track at a  major power line approximately 2 nm SW
of Waikite Valley, distance to go at 9 nm. What is the CA?*

CA = 2 x (60 / 9) = 2 x 6.7 = 13.4&deg;
= 13&deg; (round down because you rounded up before).

*What is the TC?*

TC = TE + CA = 8&deg; + 13&deg;
= 21&deg; right
= a heading change to 359 + 21 = 020&deg;.

*What is the ETA from the heading change to the checkpoint where you will regain your track?*

Distance = 9 nm
G/S = 107 kt
=> New ETA = 5 minutes + 0339 = 0344 UTC
