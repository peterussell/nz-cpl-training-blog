# Altimetry

There are three defintions of 'height' defined in **Civil Aviatino Rule Part 1**:

 * **Height:** vertical distance of a level, point, or object considered as a point, **measured from
   a specific datum.** Includes the vertical dimension of an object.
 * **Altitude:** vertical distance of a level, point, or object considered as a point, **measured
   from mean sea level.**
 * **Pressure Altitude:** a surface of *constant atmospheric pressure* (in hundreds of feet)
   related to a specific datum **1013.2 hPa**. Separated from other such surfaces by specific
   pressure intervals. Commonly referred to as **Flight Levels.**

A simplification:

 * **Height** (in feet) - actual number of feet above a point or level. eg. 1000' over the sea, or
   1000' over Mt. Cook. Height in both of these cases is identitical. Altitude is not. Height is
   the actual vertical distance (eg. by measuring tape) so not affected by atmospheric pressure.
 * **Altitude** is height above mean sea level. Influenced by atmospheric density.

**Flight Level**

Used in NZ for flights **from 15,000' upwards** (with minor exceptions). 15,000' is FL150.

# Altimeter Settings

 * The instrument used for vertical measurement is the **pressure altimeter** (differs from other
   types of altimeters, eg. radar altimeter). More detailed explanations are in later sections.
 * In simple terms, connected to a static port sensing atmospheric pressure. Decrease in pressure
   contracts the capsule (increase in altitude), increase in pressure expands it (decrease in
   altitude).
 * **Subscale** - instrument has a subscale setting controlled by the subscale knob, which enables
   the pilot to 'set' the altimeter to a certain pressure datum, eg. sea level at 1010 hPa.

**Types of Altimeter Settings**

 * **QNH:** sea level pressure. When set to QNH the altimeter reads **altitude**.
 * **QNE:** ISA sea level pressure (1013.25 hPa). When set to QNE the altimeter reads **flight levels**.
 * **QFE:** field elevation - means pressure at a selected datum.

*Fun fact: QNH means 'Question Nil Height', QNE is 'Question Nill Elevation', and QNF 'Question
Field Elevation'.

QFE is not officially used in NZ, but is in some other countries (and still in NZ syllabus). Sometimes
used for circuit training at an elevated airfield.

**Sea level Pressure (QNH)**

 * Setting QNH allows us to determine vertical separation by comparing elevation of hills etc. to
   our indicated altitude.
 * *eg. flying from an airport with field elevation of 1,300', and a **zone QNH** of 1021 hPa. If parked
   on the tarmac, altimeter reads aerodrome elevation of 1,300'. An aircraft in the circuit 1,000'
   above the aerodrome would read 2,300'. etc.*

**Height vs. Altitude**

Height is clearance above the ground, altitude is above sea level. *eg. an altitude of 4,500' over a
3,000' tall mountain gives a height of 1,500'.*

# Effect of Variations on MSL Pressure

 * Typical isobar patterns show that it'd be unusual to conduct a flight with constant pressure
   the entire time.
 * QNH is based on sea level pressure, so we need to update the altimeter setting as we fly, from ATC
   or another reliable source.
 * Flying from high to low (pressure), look out below - you're lower than your altimeter indicates.
 * Flying from low to high (pressure) means you're higher than your altimeter indicates.

These have two important considerations:

 1. Terrain clearance.
 2. Separation from other aircraft.

# Calculating Altimeter Error

 * **1 hPa = 30'

*eg. flying from 995 hPa to 1,020 hPa means the difference (25 hPa) x 30 = 750. This means you are
750' higher than your altimeter reads.

# Temperature Effect on Altimeter Reading

 * Height of pressure levels AMSL is affected by air temperature. Other sections will cover this in
   more detail.
 * **If the air is warmer than ISA** the altimeter reads low, and you're higher than you think you
   are.
 * The opposite is true - **if the air is colder than ISA** the altimeter reads high, and you're
   lower than you think you are.

If flying from high to low (temperature), look out below.

**Calibrated Altitude**

Calibrated Altitude is indicated altitude with the correct QNH set, then corrected for instrument
error (eg. incorrect pressure at the static vent, wear on tubes, etc.)

# Transition Altitude

In the **New Zealand domestic Flight Information Region (FIR)**, the area QNH within a QNH zone
is *used for all aircraft operating at 13,000' and below.

 * 13,000' is known as the **transition altitude**.
 * There are **11 QNH Zones**, incorporating areas which normally have similar QNH values. These are
   shown in **AIPNZ ENR 1.7-2.**

**All aircraft 13,000' and below fly at an *altitude*.**

 * When flying **above 15,000'**, the altimeter is set to QNE (1013.2 hPa), and all aircraft then
   fly at **pressure altitudes** called **Flight Levels.**
 * With few exceptions, FL150 is known as the **transition level**, and is the lowest pressure
   altitude available for level cruise.
 * The airspace **between 13,000' and 15,000'** is known as the **transition layer**, and is not
   normally used for cruise flight.
 * When descending and passing FL150 the altimeter is set to QNH.
 * When ascending and passing 13,000' the altimeter is set to QNE.
 * This allows all aircraft to be on the same subscale setting, and is well clear of all terrain in
   NZ (8-9,000' elevation).

# Selection of Cruising Altitudes

VFR cruising altitudes apply **above 3,000' ASML or 1,000' AGL, whichever is higher**.

 * 270&deg;M - 089&deg;M : odd + 500'
 * 080&deg;M - 269&deg;M : even + 500'

Memory aid: **NOSE** (Northerly headings = odd, Southerly headings = even).

**Note: these apply to *Magnetic TRACK*, not true track of magnetic heading.
