# Measuring Distance

**Measuring Distance with a Protractor**

 * Place the centre of the protractor on the track **where the mid meridian intersects the track.**
 * Ensure it's aligned N-S and read the track off the outside scale.

**Measuring Direction & Distance with a Plotter**

 * Place the top edge of the ruler along the intended track, with the zero mark on the intersection of
   the mid meridian and track.
 * Rotate the protractor until 0&deg; is aligned with the meridian, and read track value in &deg;T.
 * Measure distance with the correct scale (NB. there are multiple scales).
 * Due to **convergency** the track direction one way is not always 180&deg; different to the other
   direction.
    * On tracks < 60-70nm convergency is insignificant, but can be important on longer tracks,
      **especially running E-W.**
    * For this reason, align the protractor with the meridian nearest the mid-point of the track.

# Magnetic Variation

 * Bearings on charts are **true** and need to be converted to magnetic.
 * **Isogonals** (lines joining places of equal magnetic variation) are indicated on the VPC and VNC
   by **dashed blue lines**.
 * NZ variation is **east** (least), so subtract from True to get Magnetic.
 * Select variation to the nearest whole degree for the greatest part of the track.
 * Variation is not constant due to the magnetic pole moving. Current variation is printed on the chart.

# Publications

**AIPNZ Volumes 1 and 4** contain important information for the VFR pilot:

 * **Communcications**
    * **FISCOM** (Flight Information Service Communication) charts for the North and South Islands, AIPNZ
      Vol 1 and 4 GEN 3.4 - 17 detailing VHF coverage **above 4,000' AMSL** (also shown on VNCs).
    * **Navaid frequencies** Vol 4 GEN 3.7, on the aerodrome charts in AIPNZ Vol 4, and on VNCs. **Hours
      of service** are published in the AIP supplement.
 * **VFR Procedures**
    * Flight planning (Vol 4, ENR 1.10-17).
    * Position reporting (Vol 1, ENR 1.1-10 and 12).
    * Visual flight rule and Special VFR tables (Vol 4, ENR 1.2-2).
    * General information on VFR operations (Vol 4, ENR 1.16-3) for high density traffic areas and/or
      areas where restrictions apply, eg. Wellington Control Zone, Southern Alps, etc.
    * Daylight times in eight zones in NZ (Vol 4, GEN 2.7):
       * Table shows an upper and lower figure. Upper figure is start of MCT, lowre figure is end of
         ECT, ie. it is officially dark before the upper figure and after the lower figure, **day VFR
         flight is not permitted outside these times.**
       * QNH zones (11 zones in NZ) (Vol 1, ENR 1.7-5).
 * **Search and Rescue** (Vol 4, GEN 3.6) and **Emergency Procedures** (Vol 1, ENR 1.7-5). Important
   information on:
    * SAR escort support
    * Procedures for pilots intercepting a distress message or witnessing a distress incident.
    * Distress and urgency messages and signals.
    * Directing support services to a distress incident.
    * Emergency telephone calls.
    * Ground-air emergency visual signalling code.
    * Emergency locator beacons.
    * Aerodrome emergency services.
    * Unlawful interference.
    * Aviation security service.

**Notes**

 * All bearings in AIPNZ Vol 4 are **magnetic**, elevations in **AMSL**, dimensions (eg. runway length)
   in **metres**, distances in **nautical miles**, visibility in **metres or kilometres.**
 * It's important to know all symbols, abbreviations, and figures that appear on the aerodrome charts.

# Operational Aspects

 * When folding VNCs (and VPCs) make sure a small area outside your intended track is visible in case of
   diversion, so you have reference to terrain, nearby aerodromes, etc.
 * When planning a cross country, mark the VPC clearly, then transfer essential information (tracks,
   block times between planned points, and similar items) to the VNC, and/or Enlargement Chart (1:250,000).
 * 1:500,000 charts are often suitable for use in flight, comply with instructor's advice in this regard.
 * Long XC flights will use a number of VNCs, store them neatly and within easy reach.
 * **When you have your destination in sight**, store the VNC in a place you can retrieve it easily if
   the flight continues past the aerodrome, and replace it with the AIPNZ Vol 4 with the appropriate
   aerodrome selected.
 * **You are required to** study the destination aerodrome, any possible enroute alternates, and
   NOTAM information when applicable.
 * Consider using bookmarks in the AIPNZ Vol 4 for aerodrome charts you may need for quick reference.

**Precautions Measuring Distances and Bearings**

 * Make sure you have the latest charts/docs.
 * Ensure ruler scale matches chart scale.
 * Apply variation correctly: chart -> compass, subtract 20&deg;, DI -> chart, add 20&deg;.
 * When determining a bearing, check whether it's TO or FROM the object.
 * Use commonsense: if you're flying from Taupo -> Napier in the morning with the sun behind you,
   something's wrong. If you calculate Wellington to Auckland as 45nm, something's wrong.
