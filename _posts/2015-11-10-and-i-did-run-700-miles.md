In September 2014 I embarked upon a vaguely epic quest to [try running 700
miles in a year][original-post]. Although it's taken me a few months for the follow
up, I'm delighted to report that in one year (+/- 1 week) I hit the 700 miles.

I've continued tracking my little excursions because it's
been fun to see the variety of distances and frequency month to month. [The
spreadsheet's here][spreadsheet]. Current status: 846.63 miles (1362.51891 km),
most of the way San Francisco to Denver - or Wellington to Auckland a couple of
times, plus a bit

So, lessons learned?

* variety = fun. Something like (per week): 1x distance, 1x short, 1x 3 miles for time, 1x intervals
* it's a fantastic way to check out new places, especially on longer runs
* it makes damn near no difference to weight without consideration for food
* it's ideal travel exercise, running shoes are way easier to fit on a plane than a bike
* don't make huge distance increases, even if you're feeling really good. The feeling of 'man, I could have run so much further' is a good fodder for wanting to go on the next run
* longer runs were often the hardest to get motived for, but they were my favourites when I was actually doing them. They're almost always the ones I remember most
* being lighter generally made runs easier, I'd usually have half a cup of coffee and something small to eat before running. I did a few runs after a beer or two -- wouldn't recommend it
* the first few minutes is often the hardest while you loosen up, if it feels crap at the start there's a good chance it'll get better (most of the time, at least...)
