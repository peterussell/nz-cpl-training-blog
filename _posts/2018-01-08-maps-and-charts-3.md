# Visual Planning Charts (VPC)

**General**

 * There are two 1:1,000,000 VPCs, one for each of North and South Islands, printed back to back.
 * Purpose is primarily pre-flight, but can also be used for in-flight navigation.
 * Provide these types of information:
    * **Topographic** - mountains, rivers, lakes, coast lines.
    * **Cultural** - cities, roads, railway lines, etc.
    * **Aeronautical (limited)** - aerodromes, airspace, navaids, etc.
    * **Isogonals** (Variation), for **1 January** for the publication year. At every 1/2 degree
      at 1 degree intervals (eg. 22.5&deg;E, 21.5&deg;E, 20.5&deg;E, etc.
 * Based on the **New Zealand Map Grid projection** (as mentioned earlier).
    * All angular relationships and shapes of surface features are correct.
    * May assume a constant scale across the chart.

**Topographic Information**

 * **Water features (hydrographic)**
    * Usually depicted in blue.
    * Include major streams and lakes only.
 * **Relief**
    * Variation in height and slope of the earth's surface above mean sea level. Several methods:
       * **Colour** - each *layer* between sea level and the highest level on the chart is assigned
         a specific colour according to a hypsometric tint table. Shades are *green at sea
         level* > dark brown > light brown > white above 6000'.
       * **Spot heights** - prominent spot heights are shown in AMSL.
       * **Maximum Elevation Figure (MEF)** - most 1-degree quadrangles have an MEF (eg. 6<sup>5</sup>)
         meaning the *highest known feature is 6500' AMSL.*

**Natural Features**

 * **Cities and towns**
    * Large cities show approximate surface area in yellow.
    * Small towns/settlements (**> 5 houses or buildings**) shown as small dots with the place name.
 * **Roads, railway lines, major power lines**
    * Most significant are shown, important for navigation.

**Aeronautical Features**

A limited amount of aeronautical information is shown on the VPC. Includes:

 * **Aerodromes**
    * Basic symbol for an aerodrome for aeroplane and helicopter operations is a circle with four
      tick marks around it (12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock).
    * **Heliports** are a smooth circle with the letter 'H' inside.
    * **Visual Aerodromes** do not have published instrument approaches, are **blue**.
    * **Instrument Aerodromes** which do, are **purple**.
    * The above two also apply to heliports (blue for visual, purple for instrument).
    * **Non-published aerodromes** (ie. status unknown) are depicted as a circle *with 8 tick
      marks* around it.
 * **Radio-Navigation Facilities**
    * Identified by purple oblong box.
 * **Airspace**
    * **Control Zones (CTR)**
       * Depicted by solid navy blue lines.
       * Lower limit is at the earth's surface.
    * **Control Areas (CTA)**
       * Depicted by solid purple lines, *thinner above 9500'*.
       * Lower limit of CTA cannot be at the surface.
    * Although all controlled airspace is **Transponder Mandatory (TM)**, TM is included in the
      airspace label.
    * Airspace will include a label, showing the type of airspace, lower and upper limits, and 'TM'
      to indicate transponder mandatory.
    * When there's insufficient space on the chart to identify airspace as above, it's shown in a
      separate table on the chart. This is also where the *name* of the airspace (eg. Auckland
      Airspace) is shown.
    * Upper limit is sometimes shown as **LLCA**, meaning **Lower Limit Controlled Airspace**, meaning
      the upper limit is whatever the bottom of the controlled airspace above it is.
 * **Special Use Airspace**
    * **Danger Areas** - shown in red
    * **Common Frequency Zones (CFZ)** - shown as open diamond borders.
    * **Mandatory Broadcast Zones (MBZ)** - shown as solid-blue dotted borders.
       * Some MBZs have a lower and upper portion, where the upper is Transponder Mandatory (TM). This
         will be shown in the label as two sets of altitudes, one with TM next to them.
    * **Flight Information Service Communication (FISCOM)** - printed in blue, relevant only in
      *uncontrolled* airspace.
    * Where space allows, a label will be included.
    * Details of special airspace is published in the **NZ Air Navigation Register** and in **ENR
      Section 5 of the AIPNZ** under their various codes (eg. D (Danger), M (Military), B (MBZ), etc.)
