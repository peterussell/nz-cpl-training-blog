# Cruise Procedures

Stabilising aircraft in the cruise configuration includes:

 * Selecting attitude and power setting to maintain planned airspeed and altitude;
 * Trimming;
 * Leaning mixture;
 * SADIE or CLEAR.

At Top of Climb (TOC) you should also obtain a fix and record this on your flight log, and include
time at TOC. You then use this to calculate G/S and confirm the flight planned ETAs and/or amend
them.

There are simple mental calculations to help determine **time** and **groundspeed**

# Mental Calculations for Time, Distance, G/S, and ETA

60 kts = 60 nm / hour = 1 nm / minute.
120 kts = 120 nm / hour = 2 nm / minute.

This gives the relationship

 * **(60 / Time) x Distance = Groundspeed**

The simplest examples from above: if we say 1 nm took 1 minute, then (60 / 1) x 1 = 1 kt G/S. If we
still took 1 minute, but travelled 2 nm, then (60 / 1) x 2 = 120 kt G/S.

When you use time intervals that readily divide 60 (or rounded values that do), these mental
calculations are easy enough to do in flight.

*Example: If you covered 38 nm in 15 minutes, what's your groundspeed?*

Answer: (60 / 15) x 38 => 4 x 38 = 152 kt

*Example: If you covered 30 nm in 9 minutes, what's your groundspeed?*

Answer: (60 / 9) x 30 => 6.7 x 30 => 6.5 x 30 = 195 kt (actual answer is 199 kt, but this is close
enough for pilot navigation).

*A more practical example:

 * TOC at 0115
 * Current pinpoint 0126
 * Distance 24 nm

What is your groundspeed?*

Answer: 0126 - 0115 = 11 minutes, and distance is 24 nm

(60 / 11) x 24 => 5.5 x 24 = 132 kt

*What is the time to the next checkpoint, 29 nm away? (Say within 15&deg; of current TMG)*

132 = (60 / t) x 29 => 132t = 29 * 60
=> t = 29 * (60 / 132)

For mental calculations, we can round these figures to 30, 60, and 130

=> t = 30 * (60 / 130)
=> t = 30 * 1/2

Now consider we've rounded our values up, so round the answer down slightly:

=> t = ~ 14 minutes.

*NB. The text uses a slightly different method and arrives at 0.45 as the multiplier -- this is fine,
except it then says 0.45 x 29, and I've got no idea how anyone could work that out in their head
while flying an aircraft.*

=> ETA at the next checkpoint, 29 nm away, is 0126 + 13 = 0140Z.

*Example:

 * Distance from A to B is 130 nm
 * Overhead A at 0400 UTC.
 * At X (along the route) you're 48 nm from A at 0418 UTC.*

Questions:

 * What is the groundspeed between A and X?
 * What is the ETA at B?

Elapsed time = 0418 - 0400 = 18 minutes. Distance is 48 nm.

=> (60 / 18) = about 3.5
=> 3.5 x 48 = 168 kt

Distance to run is 130 - 48 = 82 nm

=> (60 / 168) * 82 = ~27 minutes. (In the text this gets more accurate using 0.35 instead of 1/3,
but 0.35 * 82 is again a slightly more difficult 'mental' calculation.

=> The ETA at B is 0418 + 27 minutes = 0445 UTC.

(This is different to the text, which gets GS of 159 kt and 0447, but close enough mentally).
