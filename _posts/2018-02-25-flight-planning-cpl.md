# Flight Plan Preparation

Items required to complete a flight plan:

 * Clean, up to date VPC (1:1,000,000), and appropriate VNCs.
 * 2+ soft pencils, eraser, water-based felt pen.
 * Protractor and ruler with 1:1,000,000, 1:500,000, 1:250,000 scales, or plotter.
 * Navigation computer.
 * Flight plan form(s).
 * AIPNZ Vol 4.

You'll be given operational details of the flight, eg. start/finish points, turning points, rates of
climb/descent, speeds. Also meteorological data and aircraft performance data.

# Accuracy Requirements

**You should adhere to the following:**

 * Temperature: nearest whole &deg;C, and nearest 500' of altitude.
 * Mean altitudes in climbs and descents to nearest 500'.
 * Direction to the nearest whole degree.
 * Distances to nearest whole NM.
 * Time to nearest half minute.
 * Fuel to nearest half gallon, litre, pound, or kg.

NB. Check exam instructions for requirements.

# Flight Plan Details

**Route Details**

 * Include information on point of departure, arrival, and turning points.
 * **Take particular note of departure and arrival altitude requirements**. These are often given *above
   the aerodrome:*
    * eg. "Arrive overhead Taupo at 1,500' above the aerodrome".
    * Aerodrome (AGL) = 1335', => answer is for 2835' (not 1500', or 1335').
 * In To/From columns **abbreviate place names in accordance with the ones given in AIPNZ Vol 4.**
 * In most cases, turning points and aerodromes are also given in lat/long, you should be familiar with
   how to use these values.

**Airspeeds**

 * You'll be given CAS for climb/cruise/descent. Know how to apply temperature stated to calculate TAS.

**Temperatures**

 * Often only freezing level is given, use this to calculate temperature at the required altitude given
   2&deg;C/1000'.
 * You may also have to interpolate values between given altitude temperatures.
 * **Mean temperature for climb is taken at the '2/3 up' level.**
 * **Mean temperature for descents is taken at '1/2 way down' level.** (same as in the PPL section).
 * When entering temp on a flight plan form it's recommended you use an oblique stroke, eg. +8/5000
    * There are examples in the text, essentially the same but contained in a box on the flight plan.
    * Note: for climbs use +8 / 5000. For descents use 3.5 \ +12 (plus 12&deg; at 3,500').

**Altitudes**

 * Unless otherwise instructed, *always cruise at altitudes consistent with VFR magnetic track-altitude
   requirements* (see 'Air Law' (vol 5), Chapter 11).
 * Keep in mind you **may need to change altitude at turning points** if the magnetic track changes from
   one sector to another.
    * NB. when adjusting altitude in practice, cruise speed is generally maintained during climbs and
      descents. That said, follow examiner's instructions in an examination.
 * When filling in mean climb/descent altitudes, use the same 'oblique stroke' method use with temps,
   eg. if climbing from 1,000' to 9,500', fill in "9 1/2 / 1", or descending from 7,500' to 1,500'
   fill in "1 1/2 \ 7 1/2" (see the text for better examples).
    * *NB. this technique becomes especially useful when climb and descent columns are adjacent to
      temperature columns*
    * eg. when climbing from 2,500' and finishing at 8,500', and with a mean climb altitude of 6,500' with
      a temperature of +8&deg;C, all this information is grouped together and easy to read at a glance.

**Rate of Climb & Descent**

 * In practice you'll know the average climb and descent rates, under exam conditions *these will be given*.
 * You can see your start and finish *altitudes* from climb and descent information:
    * This gives you total climb and descent heights.
    * Divide the climb height by the rate of climb to obtain total climb time (same for descent).
    * Enter these times in the time column.
 * You will use the above information to determine position of **Top of Climb (TOC)** and **Top of Descent
   (TOD)**.

*Example: climb from 1,500' to 7,500' at 800fpm, what is the climb time?*

Answer: total climb = 6,000' at 800 fpm = 7.5 minutes = 7:30.

* Example: descent from 9,500' to 1,500' at 500 fpm, what is the descent time?*

Answer: total descent = 8,000' at 500 fpm = 16 minutes.

 * In practice you can use approximate top and bottom altitudes to make calculations easier, but if
   actual figures are required use accurate altitudes.

**Tracks**

 * Draw in all tracks from departure, through turning points, to destination.
 * Measure with plotter/protractor & ruler.
 * Mentally check the correctness of each track as you draw them in (eg. from Auckland to Wellington should
   be a southerly track - if you read 345&deg; you've mis-read the protractor.)
 * **Remember: tracks on charts are &deg;T.**

**Distances**

 * Measuring distance at the same time as measuring direction can save time.
 * Check against the *latitude divisions* on the nearest *meridian*.
    * eg. if the ruler scale shows 30 nm, place the uler with the track length marked on it against the
      latitude grid -- it should also indicate 30 nm of latitude divisions.
    * If there's a discrepancy you've probably used the wrong scale.

**Wind Velocity**

 * **Direction provided by MetService is &deg;T, and speed in knots.**
 * Climb = use value 2/3 up. Descent use value 1/2 way down.
 * Use the oblique stroke method for recording (unless instructed otherwise).
 * May have to interpolate winds for climb/cruise/descent.
